        "summary": "Two years ago, companies like Meta and OpenAI were united against military use of their tools. Now all of that has changed.",
        "content": "At the start of 2024, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI were united against military use of their AI tools. But over the next 12 months, something changed.In January, OpenAI quietly rescinded its ban on using AI for “military and warfare” purposes, and soon after it was reported to be working on “a number of projects” with the Pentagon. In November, in the same week that Donald Trump was reelected US president, Meta announced that the United States and select allies would be able to employ Llama for defense uses. A few days later, Anthropic announced that it too would allow its models to be used by the military and that it was partnering with the defense firm Palantir. As the year ended, OpenAI announced its own partnership with the defense startup Anduril. Finally, in February 2025, Google revised its AI principles to allow for the development and use of weapons and technologies that might harm people. Over the course of a single year, worries about the existential risks of AGI had virtually disappeared, and the military use of AI had been normalized.Part of the change has to do with the immense costs involved in building these models. Research on general-purpose technologies (the other GPTs) has often highlighted the importance of the defense sector as a way to overcome issues of adoption. “GPTs develop faster when there’s a large, demanding, and income-generating application sector,” economist David J. Teece wrote in 2018, “such as the US Defense Department’s purchases of early transistors and microprocessors.” The soft budget constraints and long-term nature of defense contracting, combined with the often blurry metrics of success, make the military a highly desirable customer for new technologies. Given the need of AI startups, in particular, to secure large and patient investments, the turn to military funding was perhaps inevitable. But this doesn’t explain the rapidity of the shift nor the fact that all the leading American AI research labs moved in the same direction.The past few years have dramatically shifted the landscape of capitalist competition—from one guided by neoliberal free market ideals to one saturated with geopolitical concerns. To understand the shift from neoliberalism to geopolitics, one must grok the relationships between states and their large technology companies. Such state-capitalist relationships have been central to earlier formations of imperialism—Lenin famously characterized the imperialism of his era as a merger between monopoly capital and great powers—and they remained influential throughout the 20th century. In recent decades, this took the form of a broad consensus between the tech and political elite about digital technology’s role in innovation, growth, and state power.Over recent years, however, this harmony of interests amongst elite groups has unraveled. A series of overlapping processes, gathering particular momentum in the 2010s, has dismantled this order, leaving behind the fragments of potentially new arrangements in both the United States and China.The Silicon Valley ConsensusUp until about the mid-2010s, the United States was dominated by what might be called the Silicon Valley Consensus. Here there was a broad agreement across both the political elite and tech elite about the role of technology in the world, about what was required in order to allow that technology to flourish, about what purportedly American values they embodied, and about the requirements for capital accumulation in the technology sector. For both the tech elite and the political establishment, globalized communication, capital, data, and technology served their interests.The Silicon Valley Consensus appealed to both tech and political elites because it was a belief in technology’s capacity to create an American-led world of borderless commerce and data. While the tech sector may have (initially) had more utopian impulses than the hardheaded geopolitical realism of the state, both could see their mutual projects achieved through the same means.In practice, this meant a free hand was given to the tech sector, with regulations either conspicuously absent or curiously facilitating. Deregulation was of course a core element of the broader neoliberal period, but it particularly applied to tech companies with their capacity to confuse existing regulatory categories and “disrupt” existing rules. The lack of any significant federal privacy laws or action on the status of workers in the gig economy is indicative of this broad willingness to let digital firms act as they please. Under President Bill Clinton, the Framework for Global Electronic Commerce set out policies that, according to international studies professor Henry Farrell, succeeded in “discouraging policymakers from seeking to tax or regulate” the digital economy—and instead turned to voluntary, industry-led regulation. The core belief here—one that remains operative to this day—was that any regulation would simply get in the way of innovation and the expansion of US technology and power.Most PopularNational SecurityFBI Agent’s Sworn Testimony Contradicts Claims ICE’s Jonathan Ross Made Under OathBy Tim MarchmanNational SecurityWhat to Do if ICE Invades Your NeighborhoodBy Maddy VarnerSecurity NewsGoFundMe Ignores Own Rules by Hosting a Legal-Defense Fund for the ICE Agent Who Killed Renee GoodBy Dell CameronGearWhere Are All the New Cars?By Jeremy WhiteThe regulation that did get passed was largely aimed at facilitating the expansion of digital firms. Section 230 in the Communications Decency Act of 1996, for instance, codified limited accountability for tech firms for what appeared on their online spaces—in stark contrast to other publishers. The result is that “courts applying this standard have dismissed a variety of claims against service providers including defamation, negligence, housing discrimination, and cyberstalking claims.” Section 230 also gave tech companies significant control over issues around content moderation, leaving them to decide what is and is not appropriate to appear on their services.Abroad, the Silicon Valley Consensus meant having the state cajole other countries away from policies that might harm US digital technology companies. When France proposed a 3 percent tax on the platform giants, the United States threatened 100 percent tariffs in retaliation. France eventually proceeded anyway.Efforts were also pushed to shape international trade rules in the image of the tech companies. A number of recent trade deals—such as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the US-Japan Digital Trade Agreement—have embedded within them clauses that parallel the legal protections of Section 230. Invoking the same antiquated language of the 1990s law, the clauses around “interactive computer services” have aimed to spread the same legal protections that the digital firms receive in America into other countries. The effect is a significant expansion of protection from accountability, litigation, and other legal challenges. While countries are resisting, in Trump’s first term these trade agreements were seen as “gold standards” for how digital trade should look in future agreements.Importantly, the Silicon Valley Consensus around economic and digital globalization also extended to China during this period. Not every fraction of American capital was happy to open up economic relations with China, and this formed a core tension between different elements of American capitalism in the 2000s particularly. Manufacturers were reluctant to let in cheap Chinese competitors, and organized labor resisted the outsourcing of jobs to China. The national security wing of the US state, meanwhile, also maintained concern about the potential geopolitical power of the Chinese state. But in determining the direction of US policy towards China, these groups lost out to a coalition of financial capital, platform capital, and large manufacturers looking to China as a cheap source of labor.By the late 1990s, US policy turned significantly toward opening up to China, with the goal of incorporating it into the capitalist system. In 1998, Clinton made the first presidential visit to China since the crackdown on Tiananmen Square—demonstrating the rise of economic interests over human rights concerns. Soon after, a trade agreement was signed between the two countries and the US accepted China into the WTO.Importantly, the fractions of American capital that supported these moves were also key buffers during potential geopolitical crises. They helped facilitate, political economist Ho-fung Hung writes in Clash of Empires, “quick, reconciliatory resolutions to crises such as the Taiwan missile crisis in 1996, the US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, and the clash between a US spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea in 2001.” US capital, in other words, played an important role in keeping the peace and maintaining the growing economic integration.Most PopularNational SecurityFBI Agent’s Sworn Testimony Contradicts Claims ICE’s Jonathan Ross Made Under OathBy Tim MarchmanNational SecurityWhat to Do if ICE Invades Your NeighborhoodBy Maddy VarnerSecurity NewsGoFundMe Ignores Own Rules by Hosting a Legal-Defense Fund for the ICE Agent Who Killed Renee GoodBy Dell CameronGearWhere Are All the New Cars?By Jeremy WhiteFor the leading tech companies, openness to China has been a major focus. Businesses like Apple came to rely heavily on low-wage Chinese labor to manufacture their products. As China has developed into a middle-income country, the attractiveness of its vast consumer market has grown as well, with many companies willing to accede to the Chinese state’s requirements for entry into the market.The connections between US platform capital and the Chinese economy have extended to personal levels, with a variety of tech elites seeking to curry favor with Chinese leadership. In a particularly striking case, Mark Zuckerberg learned Chinese, declared himself to be reading Xi’s book of speeches, and during a meeting with Xi, reportedly asked him to give Zuckerberg’s unborn daughter an honorary Chinese name (Xi declined). Platform capital’s support for Chinese integration was a major touchstone of the Silicon Valley Consensus.The consensus that held across the 2000s and much of the 2010s was therefore characterized by a broad harmony of interests across platform capital and the state. There was agreement around the importance of globalization, consisting of capitalist markets and underpinned by digital technologies. There was a shared desire for minimal regulation and maximal innovation, which were deemed to go hand in hand.Throughout this period, economic interests were in the ascendant. Concerns about national security took a back seat and were largely thought to be dealt with via the expansion of commerce. Even the War on Terror, despite its rhetoric, was never an existential threat—never a conflict that warranted disruption to economic globalization. The centrality of economic interests and the rise of tech’s power gave them a driver’s seat, setting the direction of travel for society and the economy.Consensus UndoneToday, the situation of platforms and states is very different. Geopolitical concerns now loom large in the mind of every policymaker and increasingly impact the investment decisions of capitalists. Prominent in this transformation is the emergence of a new fraction of Silicon Valley capital and a splitting of worldviews amongst the American tech elite.On the one side, there remains a powerful group of tech companies that continue to benefit from globalized digital capitalism. These Big Tech firms have been socially liberal and economically neoliberal—as willing to adopt a sanitized form of identity politics as they are to use the state to facilitate their global expansion. These companies remain globalist in vision to this day, in no small part because their power and business relies upon a neoliberal world of free trade in goods, services, and data. At the same time, the Big Tech companies have also undergone a transformation over the past decade: They rely to a growing degree on the state as a defender of their interests abroad, they have increasingly become part of the national security state, and they have turned decisively against the liberal and left positions of their rank-and-file workers.On the other side, there is the growing influence of a newly prominent tech right. In contrast to the more orthodox and unified neoliberals of Big Tech, this grouping contains a multitude of competing radical ideologies and ideas—from libertarian network state utopias to techno-monarchist visions to openly eugenicist views. This grouping has always existed to some degree in the Silicon Valley world, but in recent decades they largely receded to the background. Whereas much of Big Tech has traditionally been staunchly Democratic, this grouping has often been openly pro-Trump from the beginning. Peter Thiel was the first big tech-elite supporter of Trump in 2016, and Anduril’s founder Palmer Luckey has said he was fired from Meta for donating to Trump. (Meta denies this story.) While benefiting from Trump’s rise, this group’s newfound prominence also reflects broader changes: the rise of the far right across the world, the managerial crackdown on tech workers, and the broad post-neoliberal shift overseen by both Trump and President Biden.Most PopularNational SecurityFBI Agent’s Sworn Testimony Contradicts Claims ICE’s Jonathan Ross Made Under OathBy Tim MarchmanNational SecurityWhat to Do if ICE Invades Your NeighborhoodBy Maddy VarnerSecurity NewsGoFundMe Ignores Own Rules by Hosting a Legal-Defense Fund for the ICE Agent Who Killed Renee GoodBy Dell CameronGearWhere Are All the New Cars?By Jeremy WhiteThe rise of geopolitical competition has also meant growing political attention, VC funding, and congressional budgets are available to capture. The old neoliberal ideas of connecting the world through corporate infrastructure have given way to visions of an irreconcilable great power conflict. And while the more neoliberal group either benefits significantly from the global spread of their businesses or relies in large part on exports, the new tech right often has the US government as a major customer and has security-driven desires to reshore manufacturing.The rise of this competing center of tech power has meant that the consensus moment is over—and in its place, there is now a hegemonic struggle over how American tech and the American state will work together. Two of the biggest points of contention concern to what ends the tech elite and political elite work together, and what vision of the international order they entail.On the first point, the new tech right invokes a transformation whereby the state-tech complex is not centered on the liberal expansion of digital markets, but instead on securing the nation in the face of geopolitical rivals. For the new tech right, the most prominent examples are the emerging defense tech startups that are aiming to replace the incumbent defense contractors. The stakes are high: The Pentagon spent over $14 trillion in the first two decades of the 21st century, with around one-third going just to the five largest contractors.Against these incumbents, the new military industrial complex promises a far nimbler set of startups that offer quicker and more adaptive innovation. Venture capitalists have also broadly fallen in line with this new techno-nationalist viewpoint. Particularly influential, given the highly concentrated nature of the industry, have been the signals from leading firms like Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst. New investment funds are being created, and there is a growing and vocal group of VCs arguing for a turn to defense industrialization. There are early signs that a culture shift is also underway among the more rank-and-file workers of the tech sector. What was once a quite liberal space is now seeing a growing number of workers reject earlier protests against contracts with the military, seeing these protests as symptoms of an anti-American viewpoint.While maintaining their globalized visions, the Big Tech fraction has also increasingly sought to ingratiate themselves more closely with national security agencies around the world. Amazon, in particular, has become a de facto essential infrastructure for the military—signing cloud computing deals with the CIA and other US intelligence agencies in 2013, a further deal in 2020, a $10 billion contract with the NSA in 2021, and a new contract with the US Army in 2024. But all of the cloud giants have created specialized infrastructures for security agencies and even for the traditional military industrial giants.Beyond the flows of money, there are also the flows of personnel, with significant revolving doors between tech companies and the military ensuring tighter and more integrated networks between the two. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have all long carried on this practice, and in 2024 OpenAI joined the fray when it appointed Paul M. Nakasone, a former NSA official, to its board of directors. And as conflicts have emerged around the world, Big Tech companies are increasingly becoming active participants—from securing Ukrainian government data to providing infrastructure for Israel’s war in Gaza. The 21st-century national security state is increasingly being built on the infrastructure owned and operated by Big Tech, tying these digital giants into a new military industrial complex.Most PopularNational SecurityFBI Agent’s Sworn Testimony Contradicts Claims ICE’s Jonathan Ross Made Under OathBy Tim MarchmanNational SecurityWhat to Do if ICE Invades Your NeighborhoodBy Maddy VarnerSecurity NewsGoFundMe Ignores Own Rules by Hosting a Legal-Defense Fund for the ICE Agent Who Killed Renee GoodBy Dell CameronGearWhere Are All the New Cars?By Jeremy WhiteThis raises a second major shift in the tech-state relationship—the changing visions of the international order. Alongside growing support for techno-nationalism, the national security interests in favor of stymying China have been let loose in recent years. Deploying a range of tools—tariffs, investment screening, export controls, and more—the US has definitively shifted away from the neoliberal era of globalization and free trade.Rhetoric about the threat of Chinese competition has been weaponized by a number of tech companies to resist regulation. And the major AI startups have also recently begun pushing the narrative of a zero-sum struggle between the US and China. Sam Altman went from emphasizing the need to talk and engage with China about AI, to arguing in The Washington Post that the future of AI should be in the hands of a “US-led coalition of like-minded countries.”Similarly, Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, went from worrying about the dangers of an AI race between the US and China, to insisting that there is a division between democratic countries and authoritarian ones, and that democracies must win the struggle for AI. By contrast, the hyperscaler AI firms and semiconductor companies have largely refrained from stoking geopolitical tensions. As befitting their global footprint and desire for a more neoliberal world, they routinely advocate for a world built around the free flow of goods, services, and data instead.All of this reflects a major breakdown of the Silicon Valley Consensus. Whereas once the united goal of the American state and platform capital was a globalized world of trade and technology, today we are seeing the techno-nationalistic fracturing of this order. The vaguely socially liberal elements of Silicon Valley are being attacked and replaced with an increasingly virulent right wing that is aligning with the state via government contracts and a bipolar vision of the world. Our period is characterized by competing hegemonic visions between a neoliberal globalization on the one hand and Manichean visions of the global order on the other hand, and we are in desperate need of alternatives. The future is far from settled.Excerpt adapted from Silicon Empires: The Fight for the Future of AI, by Nick Srnicek. Published by arrangement with Polity Books. Copyright © 2026 Nick Srnicek."

        "summary": "In the second Trump administration, online conspiracy theories are shaping real-world policies like never before.",
        "content": "In President Donald Trump’s second term, everything is content. Videos of immigration raids are shared widely on X by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), conspiracy theories dictate policy, and prominent right-wing podcasters and influencers have occupied high-level government roles. The second Trump administration is, to put it bluntly, very online.Trump and his supporters have long trafficked in—and benefited from—misinformation and conspiracy theories, leveraging them to build visibility on social media platforms and set the tone of national conversations. During his first term, Trump was famous for announcing the administration’s positions and priorities via tweet. In the years since, social media platforms have become friendlier environments for conspiracy theories and those who promote them, helping them spread more widely. Trump’s playbook has adjusted accordingly.Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, says that social media, particularly right-wing social media ecosystems, are no longer just a way for Trump to control conversations and public perception. The administration, he says, is now actively making decisions and shaping policy based primarily on how they'll be perceived online. Their priority is what right-wing communities care about—regardless of whether it's real.WIRED spoke to Moynihan, who argues that the US has entered a new level of enmeshment between the internet and politics, in what he calls a “clicktatorship.”This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.WIRED: To start us off, what is the “clicktatorship”?Don Moynihan: A “clicktatorship” is a form of government that combines a social media worldview with authoritarian tendencies. This implies that people working in this form of government are not just using online platforms as a mode of communication, but that their beliefs, judgment, and decisionmaking reflect, are influenced by, and are directly responsive to the online world to an extreme degree. The “clicktatorship” views everything as content, including basic policy decisions and implementation practices.The supply of a platform that encourages right-wing conspiracies and the demand of an administration for people who can traffic in those conspiracies is what's giving us the current moments of “clicktatorship” that we're experiencing.The “clicktatorship” is generating these images to justify the occupation of American cities by military forces, or to justify cutting off resources to states that did not support the president, to do things that would have truly shocked us a decade ago.Trump’s first presidency was characterized by a sort of showmanship. How is that different from what we’re seeing now?The first Trump presidency might be understood as a “TV presidency,” where watching The Apprentice or Fox News gave you real insight into the milieu in which Trump was operating. The second Trump presidency is the “Truth Social or X presidency,” where it is very hard to interpret without the reference points of those online platforms. Some of the content and messaging that the president or other senior policymakers use is stuffed with inside references, messaging that doesn't make a lot of sense unless you're already in that online community.Modes of discourse have also changed. We’re seeing very senior policymakers exhibit the patterns and habits that work online. Pam Bondi going to a Senate hearing with a list of zingers and printed-out X posts as a means of responding to a traditional accountability process, reflects how this online mode of discourse is shaping how public officials view their real-life roles.There’s been a lot of research about the polarizing and harmful nature of social media. What does it mean that our political leaders are people who have not only been successful in manipulating social media, but have themselves been manipulated by it?Most PopularNational SecurityFBI Agent’s Sworn Testimony Contradicts Claims ICE’s Jonathan Ross Made Under OathBy Tim MarchmanNational SecurityWhat to Do if ICE Invades Your NeighborhoodBy Maddy VarnerSecurity NewsGoFundMe Ignores Own Rules by Hosting a Legal-Defense Fund for the ICE Agent Who Killed Renee GoodBy Dell CameronGearWhere Are All the New Cars?By Jeremy WhiteSocial media is cooking the brains of people who spend a lot of time on it, including policymakers and elected officials. Traditionally, we thought about politicians as communicators, and that's shaped how we think about their use of social media, that it's a way of getting information out there. For a long time, most of us thought about Trump in that way, as someone who was very skillful at communicating and manipulating social media to draw support. As a candidate, he rolled into Republican awareness because of his willingness to trade in conspiracy theories, starting with President Obama's birthplace, for example.But Trump and a lot of people who work for him are also people who are consumers of social media and consumers of some pretty dark corners of the online world. They're not just manipulating the message, they're also being manipulated by the world that they inhabit.They are addicted to, and affected by, the social media environment they occupy. That feels like a different way of thinking about social media than we've thought about before.Even platform content moderators have said that they ended up believing in conspiracy theories from watching the content they’re meant to police. For people like Trump and Elon Musk, who have shown themselves to be adept at weaponizing false information, where’s the line between being strategic and getting high on your own supply?The people at the top of that food chain are not immune from the effects of the type of content they're promoting. Elon Musk is a good example here. Probably the most consequential thing that took place during the first year of the Trump administration was the elimination of USAID. This was done mostly, it seemed, because there was some ideological opposition to USAID within the administration. But also because Musk seemed to genuinely believe these conspiracy theories that were founded on nothing. This was probably the first federal agency that was killed by online conspiracy theories and the cost in human life is potentially going to be in the millions as a result.These leaders are not just consuming content and conspiracies, they’re creating their own content to feed this online community. Can you talk about that?To actively engage in that world, they are thinking about their decisions as potential content that will fit into an online environment. So I think it's affecting both the judgment and decisionmaking of the people who are running our government.When Trump [was talking about deploying the National Guard] to Portland, Oregon, if you were looking at online content about Portland and the conflict between protesters and ICE there, you would imagine that the city was torn apart. In reality, everyday life in Portland is completely normal, and there is one federal building that's the site of friction where protesters are constantly protesting.But the president is looking for images that will justify him extending and abusing authority in these places. He understands that imagery is part of that justification. The more content he can produce that suggests a breakdown of order, the greater the permission he will have to do more extreme things.Most PopularNational SecurityFBI Agent’s Sworn Testimony Contradicts Claims ICE’s Jonathan Ross Made Under OathBy Tim MarchmanNational SecurityWhat to Do if ICE Invades Your NeighborhoodBy Maddy VarnerSecurity NewsGoFundMe Ignores Own Rules by Hosting a Legal-Defense Fund for the ICE Agent Who Killed Renee GoodBy Dell CameronGearWhere Are All the New Cars?By Jeremy WhiteSocial media used to bill itself as a democratizing force. What does that look like now?We used to talk about the “platform-to-policymaking pipeline” in much more measured terms. There's a bunch of my research that got in front of government officials because I used to spend a lot of time on Twitter. That felt like a reasonably democratic process by which people who might not be in DC could, if their ideas were compelling enough, reach out and engage. But the dynamics of the platform-to-policy pipeline are determined by the people who control the platform.The way Musk has restructured Twitter is to encourage more conspiratorial content, to encourage people who are basically professional posters by rewarding them and promoting them over people who actually know what they're talking about. Then the Trump administration is looking for those people and wants to put them into positions of power, or is listening to them and their ideas. I think very online people who are also policymakers tend to respond to very online voices.How should we think of the role of platforms, specifically X, in all this?I think if you simply describe the relationship between X, Musk, and the Trump administration in purely factual terms, it's very hard not to conclude that there is a relationship where, to some degree, X serves as an extension of the state, but also the state serves as an extension of Musk's interests. The richest man in the world, the president's largest donor, turned an influential platform into a space that supported Trump's agendas, then was invited to make radical changes to American government, and while benefiting mightily from American government contracts. They are legally independent, but there's such a practical interdependence in how they were working in Trump's second term that you can't really think about the influence and power of one without referencing the other."

        "summary": "In response to a growing backlash, Microsoft said it would take steps to ensure that data centers don’t raise utility bills in surrounding areas and address other public concerns.",
        "content": "Microsoft said on Tuesday that it would be taking a series of steps toward becoming a “good neighbor” in communities where it is building data centers—including promising to ask public utilities to set higher electricity rates for data centers.Speaking onstage at an event in Great Falls, Virginia, Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith directly referenced a growing national pushback to data centers, describing it as creating “a moment in time when we need to listen, and we need to address these concerns head-on.”“When I visit communities around the country, people have questions—pointed questions. They even have concerns,” Smith said, as a slide showed headlines from various news outlets about opposition to data centers. “They are the type of questions that we need to heed … We are at a moment of time when people have a lot on their mind. They worry about the price of electricity. They wonder what this big data center will mean to their water supply. They look at this technology and ask, What will it mean for the jobs of the future? What will it mean for the adults of today? What will it mean for their children?”The announcement follows a post from President Donald Trump on Truth Social on Monday in which he pledged that his administration would work with “major American Technology Companies,” including Microsoft, to make sure that data centers don’t inflate customer utility bills.“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI,” Trump wrote in the post, in which he also accused Democrats of being responsible for the rise in utility bills. “Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’”Average electricity bills have risen faster than inflation in recent years in many parts of the country. These price hikes are due to a variety of factors, including the costs of repairing and maintaining the country’s aging electric grid. But higher demand for electricity—including from data centers, which can also be expensive to connect to the grid—plays a role. As technology companies and utilities are predicting a massive new need for energy from the nationwide data center build-out, the Energy Information Administration projects that electric bills will keep increasing through 2026.Concerns around data centers and electricity bills played a key role in several local and state midterm elections last year, while research released last fall shows that local opposition to data centers skyrocketed in the second quarter of 2025, leading to billions of dollars in projects stalled or canceled. The political divide against data centers appears to be bipartisan. In recent months, influential former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has begun speaking against the energy and water costs of data centers on his War Room podcast, part of a larger pushback from some MAGA figureheads against the AI build-out in the US.The Trump administration, by contrast, has made expediting the data center build-out in the US a key priority. It removed a variety of environmental protections for data centers, including water protections, expedited the review of chemicals involved in their use, and encouraged their development on federal land. The Department of Energy has also instructed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate transmission, to work on a suite of issues around data centers and the grid.Microsoft, which has around 100 data centers planned or under construction across the country, has met with some local pushback to some of its projects. In October, the company canceled plans for a data center in Wisconsin due to local opposition; the group leading the charge against that project warned of a potential “5 to 15 percent rate hike to subsidize cheap power.” The company revealed last week that it was also behind a proposed project in Michigan, which was put on hold in December following concerns from community members. Hundreds of residents attended a planning commission meeting for the project Monday night, with many telling local media they were there to express opposition."

But Austin-based startup SkyFi has built a platform that acts as a sort of “Getty Images” for more than 50 geospatial imagery partners that has proven popular in the worlds of finance, defense, infrastructure, and insurance — to name a few.\n\nThat popularity escalated as SkyFi began offering more analytics and insights to its customers through its website and mobile app, along with the ability to “task” satellites to capture images of a location at a specific time, CEO Luke Fischer recently told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\n“I think the real goal for us is providing answers for customers, both government and commercial,” Fischer said. “Imagery is a commodity, or it’s closely becoming a commodity, [so it’s] not just about speed of delivery, but more importantly, speed of delivery of answers to customers.”\n\nBeing able to offer insights along with easy-to-access imagery is a big reason why SkyFi was just able to close a $12.7 million Series A funding round, according to Fischer. \n\nThat’s reflected in the investor makeup of the round. It was co-led by climate-focused fund Buoyant Ventures and IronGate Capital Advisors, which invests in dual-use companies. Other investors included DNV Ventures (the investment arm of 160-year-old maritime company DNV), Beyond Earth Ventures (a space-focused firm), and TFX Capital (which has made a number of defense-related space investments).\n\nFischer said he and co-founder Bill Perkins — who comes from the hedge fund world, hence the emphasis on generating actionable insights — initially only sought to raise a round of about $8 million. \nBut 2025 was a record year for defense-related investments, and SkyFi received more investor demand than expected, Fischer said. The company upped its target to $10 million, and again to $12 million, before arriving at the $12.7 million figure after some strategic investors joined the round. (One was DNV; Fischer declined to name the other on the record.) \n\nFischer said SkyFi used to have a harder time convincing satellite imagery providers to hand over access to their data. Now, he said, onboarding new providers is “table stakes.” \n\n“It took a took a little bit for us to get to this point, [but] we have largest virtual constellation of assets. That means we have all the data supply in the world for us, all the different sensor types,” he said. SkyFi has been able to leverage all of that data and, crucially, the many requests it’s received from customers over the last few years to build up analytical offerings worth selling to commercial and government customers. \n\n“We know better than anyone what they’re asking for,” he said.\n\nFischer said he learned first-hand how powerful this kind of feedback loop can be from his time helping lead Uber’s Elevate division. \n\n“Uber has data on where people move in the world. They layer different products, the bikes, the scooters, the electric aircraft, the drone delivery. We have that equivalent data on what people are looking at in the world they’re asking of that data,” he said. “It gives us a much better purview. And again. We’re software first, so I don’t have the burden of having to pay for hardware capital expenses.”\n\nSome of those customers will want to do their own analytics, like the hedge funds, Fischer explained. But most are increasingly interested in what SkyFi has to offer on the insights side, he said. \n\nThe company plans to use the new funding to expand on all this, though Fischer is clearly proud of building a product that is deeply capable but inherently approachable, to the point that even his family uses the product.\n\n“My teenage daughters task satellites for their high school, and now college, homework on their iPhones,” he said."

        "summary": "The tech giant has pledged to be a \"good neighbor\" as it continues to invest in AI infrastructure throughout the country.",
        "content": "Although public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.\n\n“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”\n\nThe company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.\n\nIt’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.\n\nThis backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.\nConcerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”\n\nIn short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide."

        "content": "Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.\n\nIn a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”\n\nOwens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.\n\nShe also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.\n\nAfter TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.\n\nIn a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”\n\nIn a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.\nOwens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”\n\nThe Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.\n\nEven if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.\n\nShe is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”\n\nAlthough Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\n\nWhile many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.\n\nThe problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.\n\nThat means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.\n\nUntil then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware."

        "summary": "AI is ushering in Ring’s next chapter, as the Amazon-owned video doorbell maker shifts toward becoming an “intelligent assistant.”",
        "content": "What does it take to bring a burned-out founder back to the company he sold to Amazon? For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.\n\nSiminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal shipped just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” conversational AI, facial recognition features, and more. Some of these additions have not been without controversy, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.\n\n“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.” \n\nBy 2023, five years after selling Ring to Amazon, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he needed out. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”\n\nWhen he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans. \n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nThough Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform. \n\n“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, destroying the garage where Ring was built.\n\nOne of Ring’s new additions, Fire Watch, was inspired by this tragedy. In partnership with the nonprofit fire monitoring organization Watch Duty, Ring customers will be able to opt in to share footage when a massive fire event happens, allowing the organization to build a better map that can be used to help deploy firefighting resources more efficiently. The AI will be used in that case to look for smoke, fire, embers, and more in the shared footage.\n\nImage Credits:Ring\n\nAnother recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected.\n\n“I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match.\n\nImage Credits:Ring\n\nOther moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.\n\nSiminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage. \n\n“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.  \n\nHe also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.\n\n“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.” \n\nDespite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target.\n\nAnother AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator.\n\nImage Credits:Ring\n\nThe facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely. \n\nSiminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention. \n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nHe argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it. \n\n“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.” \n\nBut with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else."

        "content": "Dr. Sina Bari, a practicing surgeon and AI healthcare leader at data company iMerit, has seen firsthand how ChatGPT can lead patients astray with faulty medical advice.\n\n“I recently had a patient come in, and when I recommended a medication, they had a dialogue printed out from ChatGPT that said this medication has a 45% chance of pulmonary embolism,” Dr. Bari told TechCrunch. \n\nWhen Dr. Bari investigated further, he found that the statistic was from a paper about the impact of that medication in a niche subgroup of people with tuberculosis, which didn’t apply to his patient. \n\nAnd yet, when OpenAI announced its dedicated ChatGPT Health chatbot last week, Dr. Bari felt more excitement than concern.\n\nChatGPT Health, which will roll out in the coming weeks, allows users to talk to the chatbot about their health in a more private setting, where their messages won’t be used as training data for the underlying AI model.\n\n“I think it’s great,” Dr. Bari said. “It is something that’s already happening, so formalizing it so as to protect patient information and put some safeguards around it […] is going to make it all the more powerful for patients to use.”\n\nUsers can get more personalized guidance from ChatGPT Health by uploading their medical records and syncing with apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags. \n“All of a sudden there’s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,” Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. “So I’m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.”\n\nBut the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots — over 230 million people already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week. \n\n“This was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,” Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. “So it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.”\n\nAI chatbots have a persistent problem with hallucinations, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara’s Factual Consistency Evaluation Model, OpenAI’s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (Anthropic also announced a health product this week).\n\nFor Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice.\n\n“Right now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor — the wait time will be three to six months,” Dr. Shah said. “If your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?”\n\nDr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side. \n\nMedical journals have often reported that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician’s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor.\n\nDr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing ChatEHR, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient’s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner.\n\n“Making the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,” Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine article. “ChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters — talking to patients and figuring out what’s going on.” \n\nAnthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers.\n\n“Some of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,” said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan’s Healthcare Conference. “So imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them — it’s a dramatic time savings.”\n\nAs AI and medicine become more intertwined, there’s an inescapable tension between the two worlds — a doctor’s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble.\n\n“I think that tension is an important one,” Dr. Bari said. “Patients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.”"

        "content": "The robotics company behind the Neo humanoid robot, 1X, has unveiled a new AI model that it says understands the dynamics of the real world and can help bots learn new information on their own.\n\nThis physics-based model, called 1X World Model, uses a combination of video and prompts to give Neo robots new abilities. The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren’t previously trained on, according to 1X.\n\nThis release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up preorders for its humanoids in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations.\n\n“After years of developing our world model and making Neo’s design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo’s ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.”\n\nSaying that the bot can transform any prompt into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can’t tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on. \n\n1X isn’t saying the world model allows today’s Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how. \n\nIt also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. That kind of behavioral information could help 1X train these models to a point where robots will be able to react to a prompt of something they’ve never done before."

We started the company in 2022 and launched the first product in 2023.

In a separate post on X, the company noted that enterprises have deployed its technology to handle more than 50,000 calls per month.\n\nThe startup raised $180 million in Series C funding co-led by a16z and ICONIQ Growth at a $3.3 billion valuation in January 2025. It then doubled its valuation months later when ICONIQ and another earlier investor, Sequoia, shelled out another $100 million to snap up employee shares.\n\nBesides providing models for voice generation and voice agents, the company launched music creation capabilities last year and also struck a deal with celebrities such as Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to use their voices for AI-generated content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\t\tAI, ElevenLabs, Enterprise, In Brief, voice AI\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDates TBD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLocations TBA\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlan ahead for the 2026 StrictlyVC events.

        "summary": "Deepgram is raising its Series C round at a $1.3 billion valuation.",
        "content": "Usage of voice AI in sales, marketing, customer support, and consumer applications has shot up in the last few years. As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, Deepgram said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.\n\nThe round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. \n\nThe startup’s raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including Sesame’s $250 million Series B, ElevenLab’s $180 million Series C, and Gradium’s $70 million seed round.\n\nElizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area.\n\n“In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales developments. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that’s what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said.\n\nShe noted that voice AI could help in making customers’ interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. \n\nDeepgram has a bunch of models related to text-to-speech and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio.\nThe company’s CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn’t need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year.\n\n“In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said.\n\n“We weren’t out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.”\n\nThe company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell withdrew its voice AI experiment after a person ordered 18,000 water cups.\n\n“I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn’t provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said.\n\nThere seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne’s acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl’s Jr., picked up $10 million in new funding.\n\nAnalysts’ reports peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions."

        "content": "Slackbot, the automated assistant baked into the Salesforce-owned corporate messaging platform Slack, is entering a new era as an AI agent. And Salesforce CTO Parker Harris hopes it will be as viral as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nThe cloud software giant rolled out the new version of Slackbot on Tuesday. This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it’s granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack.\n\nSalesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference in October, is just one piece of Salesforce’s enterprise AI-heavy product plan.\n\nHarris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known.\n\nHarris added that Slack doesn’t generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates.\n\n“It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It’s powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.”\n\nSalesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they’ve released, he said.\n“Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted, not mandated, in corporations.”\n\nThis is just the beginning of Slackbot’s second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users.\n\n“I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said."

        "content": "Brazil’s competition watchdog has ordered WhatsApp to put on hold its policy that bars third-party AI companies from using its business API to offer chatbots on the app. The agency has also started an investigation against the company to determine if the policy is anti-competitive.\n\n“According to the investigations, there is possible anti-competitive conduct of an exclusive nature that arises from the application of the New WhatsApp Terms (“WhatsApp Business Solution Terms”) imposed by Meta to regulate the access and offer, by providers of artificial intelligence tools, of its technologies to WhatsApp users,” the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (CADE) said.\n\nCADE said it would investigate if Meta’s terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company’s chatbot that’s offered on WhatsApp.\n\nMeta last October changed its terms of use for the WhatsApp Business API to ban third-party AI companies from offering their chatbots on the app. Companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Microsoft soon after noted that after the policy goes into force from January 15, their chatbots would no longer be offered on WhatsApp. Notably, Meta’s policy does not stop businesses from offering their own chatbots, AI-powered or otherwise, within WhatsApp to their customers.\n\nCADE’s investigation comes after the European Union launched its own antitrust investigation into the new policy, as has Italy. If the EU finds Meta in breach of its antitrust rules, it could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue. \n\nMeta has told AI providers that they can continue offering their AI chatbots to users in Italy even after the new rules go into force on January 15, according to a notice to developers seen by TechCrunch. The company could make a similar decision in Brazil following CADE’s order. \n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment outside regular business hours.\nThe company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.\n\n“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said when the company changed the terms in October."

Converge Bio is the latest company to ride that shift, securing new capital as competition in the AI-driven drug discovery space heats up.\n\nThe Boston- and Tel Aviv-based startup, which helps pharma and biotech companies develop drugs faster using generative AI trained on molecular data, has raised a $25 million oversubscribed Series A round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners. TLV Partners, Saras Capital, and Vintage Investment Partners also joined the round, along with additional backing from unidentified executives at Meta, OpenAI, and Wiz.\n\nIn practice, Converge trains generative models on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, then plugs them into pharma and biotech’s workflows to speed up drug development.\n\n“The drug-development lifecycle has defined stages — from target identification and discovery to manufacturing, clinical trials, and beyond — and within each, there are experiments we can support,” Converge Bio CEO and co-founder Dov Gertz said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “Our platform continues to expand across these stages, helping bring new drugs to market faster.”\n\nSo far, Converge has rolled out customer-facing systems. The startup has already introduced three discrete AI systems: one for antibody design, one for protein yield optimization, and one for biomarker and target discovery.\n\n“Take our antibody design system as an example. It’s not just a single model. It’s made up of three integrated components. First, a generative model creates novel antibodies. Next, predictive models filter those antibodies based on their molecular properties. Finally, a docking system, which uses a physics-based model, simulates the three-dimensional interactions between the antibody and its target,” Gertz continued. The value lies in the system as a whole, not any single model, according to the CEO. “Our customers don’t have to piece models together themselves. They get ready-to-use systems that plug directly into their workflows.”\n\nThe new funding comes about a year and a half after the company raised a $5.5 million seed round in 2024.  \nSince then, the two-year-old startup has scaled quickly. Converge has completed over 40 programs with more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotech customers, Gertz said. It works with customers across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Israel and is now expanding into Asia.\n\nThe team has also grown rapidly, increasing to 34 employees from just nine in November 2024. Along the way, Converge has begun publishing public case studies. In one, the startup helped a partner boost protein yield by 4 to 4.5X in a single computational iteration. In another, the platform generated antibodies with extremely high binding affinity, reaching the single-nanomolar range, Gertz noted.\n\nImage Credits:Converge Bio\n\nAI-driven drug discovery is experiencing a surge of interest. Last year, Eli Lilly teamed up with Nvidia to build what the companies called the pharma industry’s most powerful supercomputer for drug discovery. And in October 2024, the developers behind Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold project won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that can predict protein structures.\n\nWhen asked about the momentum and how it is shaping Converge Bio’s growth, Gertz said that the company is witnessing the largest financial opportunity in the history of life sciences and the industry is shifting from “trial-and-error” approaches to data-driven molecular design.\n\n“We feel the momentum deeply, especially in our inboxes. A year and a half ago, when we founded the company, there was a lot of skepticism,” Gertz told TechCrunch. That skepticism has vanished remarkably quickly, thanks to successful case studies from companies like Converge and from academia, he added.\n\nLarge language models are gaining attention in drug discovery for their ability to analyze biological sequences and suggest new molecules, but challenges like hallucinations and accuracy remain. “In text, hallucinations are usually easy to spot,” the CEO said. “In molecules, validating a novel compound can take weeks, so the cost is much higher.” To tackle this, Converge pairs generative models with predictive ones, filtering new molecules to reduce risk and improve outcomes for its partners. “This filtration isn’t perfect, but it significantly reduces risk and delivers better outcomes for our customers,” Gertz added.\n\nTechCrunch also asked about experts like Yann LeCun, who remain skeptical about using LLMs. “I’m a huge fan of Yann LeCun, and I completely agree with him. We don’t rely on text-based models for core scientific understanding. To truly understand biology, models need to be trained on DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules,” Gertz explained.\n\nText-based LLMs are used only as support tools, for example, to help customers navigate literature on generated molecules. “They’re not our core technology,” Gertz said. “We’re not tied to a single architecture. We use LLMs, diffusion models, traditional machine learning, and statistical methods when it makes sense.”\n\n“Our vision is that every life-science organization will use Converge Bio as its generative AI lab. Wet labs will always exist, but they’ll be paired with generative labs that create hypotheses and molecules computationally. We want to be that generative lab for the entire industry,” Gertz said.\n\nThe article has been updated to include information on the number of customers."

        "summary": "Hupo’s approach to sales coaching is less about replacing human judgment and more about helping people in the moments that really matter in banking, insurance, and financial services.",
        "content": "When Justin Kim, co-founder and CEO of Hupo, first launched his company about four years ago, it wasn’t selling AI-powered sales coaching to banks, finance services, or insurance companies. The company originally began as Ami, a mental wellness platform focused on how people manage pressure, form habits, and change behavior over time.\n\n“I’ve always been a big sports fan — basketball, football, Formula One, MMA — and what draws me to all of them is performance. In my free time, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what actually drives human performance. People are very different, but across sports, there are clear patterns in how performance shows up,” Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nHis curiosity eventually shaped his professional focus. Kim started exploring what drives performance at work, and one theme kept surfacing: mental resilience. That idea led him to found a startup in 2022.\n\nEarly work with Meta, which backed this startup in the seed round, helped sharpen some hard-earned lessons: Software only works when it fits into daily behavior like how people already live and work, and tools designed to help people “improve” often fail if they are judgmental, abstract, or disconnected from real work, Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nThose ideas followed the startup through its pivot, and today they shape Hupo’s approach to sales coaching; less about replacing human judgment and more about helping people in the moments that really matter in banking, insurance, and financial services.\n\nKim said the shift wasn’t as dramatic as it might seem. “The core problem in both cases is performance at scale. In banking and insurance, results vary, not because of motivation, but because training, feedback, and confidence differ. Traditional coaching can’t reach everyone, and managers can’t sit in on every conversation.”\n\nAI that understands conversations in real time now allows teams to receive consistent coaching, even in the highly regulated, complex industry, Kim noted.\nImage Credits:Hupo\n\nHupo has raised a $10 million Series A led by DST Global Partners, with participation from Collaborative Fund, Goodwater Capital, January Capital, and Strong Ventures. In addition, the Singapore-headquartered startup now serves dozens of customers in APAC and Europe, including Prudential, AXA, Manulife, HSBC, Bank of Ireland, and Grab.\n\n“BFSI [Banking, Financial Services and Insurance] is a notoriously difficult vertical for early-stage companies, but our customers typically expand contracts 3x to 8x within the first six months,” the founder said. “We’ll be expanding into the U.S. in the first half of this year, where distribution-heavy financial models create a strong need for scalable coaching.”\n\nKim started his career at Bloomberg, selling enterprise software to banks, asset managers, and insurers, where he saw how complex regulated sales could be. He later worked on product development at South Korean fintech Viva Republica, the company behind Toss, learning how technology built around real user behavior could reshape traditional financial services.\n\n“Hupo sits at the intersection of those experiences. I understood the buyer, the end user, and the operational reality of selling financial products,” Kim said. “Once AI became capable of understanding context and coaching in real time, it became obvious to me that sales coaching — especially in banking and insurance — was the right place to apply it.”\n\nMany AI sales coaching tools start with the technology first, Kim said, but Hupo took a different approach, building its platform around how banks and insurers operate. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that, especially with large enterprises, you have to understand their business and industry in detail,” he added, noting that Hupo’s models were trained from the start on real financial products, common objections, client types, and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe latest round brings total funding to $15 million since the company was founded in 2022. The new capital will go toward expanding its product, including real-time coaching features; scaling enterprise-grade deployments; growing go-to-market efforts in banking, financial services, and insurance; and building out the team.\n\nIn five years, Kim says he wants Hupo to go beyond sales coaching and help large teams perform at scale, giving managers and employees clearer insights and practical guidance, even across tens of thousands of people."

        "content": "Meta plans to cut around 10 percent of the employees in its Reality Labs division who work on products including the metaverse, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions, as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence.The cuts to Reality Labs — which has roughly 15,000 employees — could be announced as soon as Tuesday. The layoffs would be a fraction of Meta’s total work force of 78,000, but are set to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality headsets and a V.R.-based social network, said the people, who asked not to be named since they were not authorized to discuss confidential decisions. The cuts could end up affecting more than 10 percent of the division, one of the people said.Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer who oversees Reality Labs, has called a meeting for Wednesday and has urged staff to attend in person, according to a memo sent to employees last week, which was obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Bosworth said the meeting was the “most important” of the year but did not elaborate.Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, asked top executives last year to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike A.I. system."

        "content": "After a nearly yearlong delay to its efforts to compete in artificial intelligence, Apple said on Monday that it planned to base its A.I. products on technology developed by Google.The upcoming versions of Apple Foundation Models — the company’s models for its A.I. system, Apple Intelligence — will be based on Google’s Gemini A.I. models and its cloud computing services. Those models will power Apple’s personal assistant, Siri, which is commonly used in iPhones and is expected to be upgraded this year, as well as other A.I. features.“After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s A.I. technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,” the companies said in a statement.The companies did not disclose the exact terms of the multiyear deal, and a spokesman for Google said the partnership was not exclusive.Shares of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, ended trading on Monday at just under $332, making it the fourth publicly traded company to be worth more than $4 trillion.Apple has increasingly faced questions over its plans for A.I. The company has largely stayed on the sidelines as other technology juggernauts have spent tens of billions of dollars developing A.I. and as start-ups have pushed the envelope on the technology.The partnership with Google does not mean the iPhone maker is abandoning its A.I. work. But it does indicate that Apple is taking a more cautious approach than its peers. It is allowing Google to conduct the laborious — and expensive — development of core A.I. models, which requires the computing capacity of massive data centers running tens of thousands of servers.The two companies have a long history of working together. Google has provided the default search engine for Apple’s Safari web browser for years.Apple stumbled in its earlier attempts to adopt A.I. In June 2024, the company demonstrated Apple Intelligence, which included features like summarizing notifications and improving emails and text messages. Those features arrived later than expected and quickly ran into hiccups. Notification summaries misrepresented news reports, for example, and Apple disabled that feature.In March, Apple postponed the release of an improved Siri. Then, last month, Apple announced the retirement of its head of A.I., John Giannandrea. He was succeeded by Amar Subramanya, a former executive at Google and Microsoft.Apple already works with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT with Siri and Apple Intelligence. Consumers can allow Siri to use ChatGPT, for example, to answer more complex questions on behalf of the personal assistant."

        "content": "Wes Streeting has asked Jonathan Haidt, a bestselling author and high-profile advocate of banning social media for under-16s, to speak to his officials in his push for the UK to consider following a landmark ban in Australia.The health secretary has invited Haidt to address an event with staff, charities and MPs after the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was open to stricter limits for young people.Haidt came to prominence after writing Anxious Generation, in which he argued that widespread use of smartphones had caused a mental health crisis for young people.He has become a global activist for stricter rules, including bans on social media for under-16s and on smartphones in schools.Starmer said on Monday he would consider all options in curbing young people’s access to social media. “We are looking at Australia, there are different ways you can enforce it,” he told a meeting of Labour MPs.The prime minister also addressed the use of phones in school, adding: “No one thinks you should have phones in schools.”Those comments reflected a change of heart from Starmer, who previously said a social media ban would be difficult to police and could push teenagers toward the dark web.Fleur Anderson, a Labour MP who has been campaigning for stricter curbs, said: “I was really pleased to hear that the prime minister is looking seriously at the Australian model. It is time we regulated this and gave young people the protections they need.”Starmer’s words reflect a growing Westminster consensus in favour of such a move – one which has been provoked in part by the row over X’s AI tool allowing users to generate sexualised images of women and children.On Tuesday, Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats became the latest party leader to leave the door open to a social media ban for young people after a similar move by Nigel Farage of Reform UK.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, announced on Sunday she would enact a ban if elected prime minister, and would push for one from opposition. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has also said he would support such a move.Government ministers are split between those who are enthusiastic supporters of curbs on social media and those who have concerns about how they would be implemented and what the impact would be on teenagers.Streeting has been one of those most in favour of taking stronger action, telling the BBC last week: “Sometimes I feel like my concentration span suffers because of doom scrolling and the way in which information is served up in increasingly short, bite-size chunks. And I worry about what that means for the development and the cognitive development of a generation of children and young people.”As well as the event with Haidt, Streeting has asked officials to look into the details of Australia’s ban, which came into force at the start of the year.The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, is also understood to be looking at the Australian policy, though she has not commissioned a team to actively examine it.Allies say she is listening to warnings from charities such as the NSPCC that an outright ban could drive young people toward the dark web and undermine attempts to teach them how to use social media responsibly.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, share similar concerns, according to government insiders.Nandy commissioned a survey of 14,000 young people that found most did not want an outright ban. She told the Guardian last year: “The challenge with banning social media is enforcement. Are we really saying as a country that we’re going to start prosecuting under-18s for using social media?”Senior government sources say they are concerned about the possibility that Labour peers will back a Conservative-led attempt to amend the children’s wellbeing and schools bill to include a ban for under-16s.The amendment, proposed by the former minister John Nash, has been signed by the Labour peer Luciana Berger and the Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin.Government officials believe that enough Labour peers could vote for or abstain on that amendment to see it pass when it is debated next week. The issue would then come to the Commons, where several Labour MPs could join the Tories in supporting it."

        "content": "“Since discovering Grok AI, regular porn doesn’t do it for me anymore, it just sounds absurd now,” one enthusiast for the Elon Musk-owned AI chatbot wrote on Reddit. Another agreed: “If I want a really specific person, yes.”If those who have been horrified by the distribution of sexualised imagery on Grok hoped that last week’s belated safeguards could put the genie back in the bottle, there are many such posts on Reddit and elsewhere that tell a different story.And while Grok has undoubtedly transformed public understanding of the power of artificial intelligence, it has also pointed to a much wider problem: the growing availability of tools, and means of distribution, that present worldwide regulators with what many view as an impossible task. Even as the UK announces that creating nonconsensual sexual and intimate images will soon be a criminal offence, experts say that the use of AI to harm women has only just begun.Other AI tools have much stricter safeguards in place. Asked to strip a photograph of a woman into a bikini, the large language model (LLM) Claude says: “I can’t do that. I’m not able to edit images to change clothing or create manipulated photos of people.” ChatGPT and Google’s AI tool Gemini will create bikini images, but nothing more explicit.However, there are far fewer limits elsewhere. Users of the Grok forum on Reddit have been sharing tips on how to generate the most hardcore pornographic images possible using pictures of real women. On one thread, users were complaining that Grok would allow them to make images of women topless “after a struggle”, but refused to generate genitals. Others have noticed that asking for “artistic nudity” gets around safeguards around stripping women completely naked.View image in fullscreenGrok has also been used to generate deepfake images of Elon Musk in a bikini. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesBeyond LLMs and major platforms is a whole ecosystem of websites, forums and apps devoted to nudification and the humiliation of women. These communities are increasingly finding pipelines to the mainstream, said Anne Craanen, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) working on tech-facilitated, gender-based violence.Communities on Reddit and Telegram discuss how to bypass guardrails to make LLMs produce pornography, a process known as “jailbreaking.” Threads on X amplify information about nudification apps, which produce AI-generated images of women with their clothing removed, and how to use them.Craanen said the route for misogynistic content to reach the wider internet has grown broader, adding: “There is a very fruitful ground there for misogyny to thrive.”Research from the ISD last summer found dozens of nudification apps and websites, which collectively received nearly 21 million visitors in May 2025. There were 290,000 mentions of these tools on X in June and July last year. Research by the American Sunlight Project in September found that there were thousands of ads for such apps on Meta, despite the platform’s efforts to crack down on them.“There are hundreds of apps hosted on mainstream app stores like Apple and Google that make this possible,” said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert who co-founded the American Sunlight Project. “Much of the infrastructure of deepfake sexual abuse is supported by companies that we all use on a daily basis.”Clare McGlynn, a law professor and expert in violence against women and girls from Durham University, said that she feared things would only get worse. “OpenAI announced last November that it was going to allow ‘erotica’ in ChatGPT. What has happened on X shows that any new technology is used to abuse and harass women and girls. What is it that we’re going to see then on ChatGPT?“Women and girls are far more reluctant to use AI. This should be no surprise to any of us. Women don’t see this as exciting new technology, but as simply new ways to harass and abuse us and try and push us offline.”‘Add blood, forced smile’: how Grok’s nudification tool went viralRead moreJess Asato, Labour MP for Lowestoft, has been campaigning on this issue and said her critics have been gleefully creating and sharing explicit imagery of her – even since the restrictions on Grok. “It’s still happening to me and being posted on X because I speak up about it,” she added.Asato added that AI deepfake abuse has been happening to women for years, and is not limited to Grok. “I don’t know why [action] has taken so long. I have spoken to so many victims of much, much worse.”While the public Grok X account no longer generates pictures for those without a paid subscription, and there appear to have been guardrails put in place to stop it generating bikini pictures, its in-app tool has far fewer restrictions.Users are still able to create sexually explicit imagery based on fully clothed pictures of real people, with no restrictions for free users of X. Asked to strip a photograph down into bondage gear, it complies. It will also place women into sexually compromising positions, and smear them in white, semen-like substances.The point of creating deepfake nudes is often not just about sharing erotic imagery, but the spectacle of it, said Craanen – especially as the images flood platforms like X.“It’s the actual back and forth of it, [trying] to shut someone down by saying, ‘Grok, put her in a bikini,’” she said.“The performance of it is really important there, and really shows the misogynistic undertones of it, trying to punish or silence women. That also has a cascading effect on democratic norms and women’s role in society.”"

        "content": "A Home Office TikTok account posting footage of deportations and arrests set to dramatic music has been criticised for turning “brutality” into “clickbait”.An account called @SecureBordersUK was created on Tuesday with the slogan: “Restoring order and control to our borders.”The first 20-second video shows people handcuffed and escorted on to planes, and raids being carried out to arrest illegal workers.It ends with a message reading: “And it’s just getting started.”The head of asylum advocacy at Freedom From Torture, Sile Reynolds, said: “This government is clearly hooked on the cheap political points it can score by turning the brutality of enforcement raids into clickbait online entertainment.“This style of political communication provokes the kind of anxiety and fear that fuelled the summer riots and the recent violence directed at asylum hotels.”View image in fullscreenThe new account, which was set up on Tuesday. Photograph: Home Office/TikTok/PAShe added that caring people in the UK were “increasingly alarmed” by the government’s “performative cruelty” towards migrants and called for ministers to focus on uniting the country and use its TikTok account to “tell a more hopeful story about our capacity to welcome those seeking sanctuary in the UK”.Imran Hussain, the director of external affairs at the Refugee Council, said: “Only a small proportion of refugees in Europe come to the UK.“Those that do come here do so because they have existing links with the UK – like having family here, speaking English, or longstanding cultural links.Keir Starmer tells MPs he is open to social media ban for young peopleRead more“TikTok videos will not change this.”The Home Office has said the account is aimed at tackling online misinformation and to deter people from making the dangerous crossing over the Channel.The Home Office has published figures showing a record level of arrests and visits in relation to illegal working since current records began in 2019.In 2025, 12,791 visits were carried out, up 57% from 8,122 in the previous year, to businesses such as nail bars, car washes, barbers and takeaway shops.Arrests were also at a record high of 8,971 last year, up nearly 59% compared with 5,647 in 2024 – the previous highest point in data published by the Home Office.Of those arrested, 1,087 people have been removed from the UK so far.Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, said: “There is no place for illegal working in our communities. That is why we have surged enforcement activity to the highest level in British history so illegal migrants in the black economy have nowhere to hide.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “This is yet another pathetic gimmick that won’t work. The idea that putting some posts on TikTok will stop illegal immigrants is laughable – just like the government’s previous gimmick to smash the gangs.”"

        "content": "For most of Iran, the internet was shut off on Thursday afternoon – the most severe blackout the country has seen in years of internet shutdowns, coming after days of escalating anti-government protests.For a very small sliver of the country, it is still possible to get photos and videos to the outside world, and even to make calls. The Telegram channel Vahid Online on Monday posted photos of dead bodies lying next to a street in Kahrizak, on the southern outskirts of Tehran; on Sunday, it shared a video of Iranians chanting “death to Khamenei” at a funeral.Some of these videos and messages are transmitted through an ecosystem of online tools designed to bypass censorship – among them Telegram proxies and a browser called Ceno, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.By far the most significant part of this system are Starlink terminals, which connect to the internet via thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit, and have been smuggled into Iran en masse over the past two years. Those who are using them risk their lives.There are about 50,000 Starlink terminals now in Iran, said Rashidi; other reports put this number at up to 100,000. The users of the service – which is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX – are a tiny fraction of Iran’s overall population of more than 90 million people.While multiple people – even a whole apartment block – might be able to connect to the internet via a single Starlink terminal, the number of total users in the entire country is at most in the hundreds of thousands, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network observability and intelligence platform.They hold Iran’s last tenuous link to the outside world. Very little information, at least electronically, appears to be leaving the country, except for minimal traffic from businesses and individuals whitelisted by the regime.Across Iran, authorities are hunting for Starlink terminals – jamming whole neighbourhoods using tools developed for electronic warfare, and flying drones over rooftops to search for telltale satellite dishes, say sources. Under a law passed in 2025, possessing a Starlink terminal in Iran can be interpreted as espionage for Israel and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Iran’s internet shutdown chart“They have basically criminalised Starlink to the extent that they’re saying in the law [that] if you use Starlink it’s the equivalent of conducting espionage operations for Israel and the American CIA,” said Rashidi.It is unclear how many terminals are still operating, and how many have been confiscated, he added.The tools Iran appears to be using to jam the terminals are military-grade, similar to those used to jam drones on the frontlines of Ukraine, said Rashidi. They are expensive and energy-intensive, capable of knocking out a certain radio frequency within a given area, but can only be used locally and cannot blanket the country.“It’s not cheap. It’s something you’d find in a military arsenal, and there’s only a few types of suppliers,” said Madory.For now, the few who have smuggled Starlink terminals can connect online, although in neighbourhoods with heavy jamming it is nearly impossible to do more than send messages. The tech-savvy among them are using VPNs to disguise their presence; others are simply hauling their terminals from place to place to avoid detection.Chart on Iran’s internet shutdown and protestsWhile Starlink users can communicate for now, Iran could choose – though it would be difficult – to track them down.“Depending on how much effort the Iranian government wanted to put into it, they could trace the signals that use the particular frequency those terminals have to use,” said Madory. “You’re kind of announcing yourself.”For those without a terminal, an announcement on a state-linked Telegram channel has given a preview to the potential future of the internet in Iran. The IRIB news agency yesterday published a list of all internet sites that would now be available in Iran.These included domestic search engines, domestic maps and navigation services, domestic messaging apps, and even a domestic streaming service – an Iranian version of Netflix, said Rashidi, with only government-approved videos.All of these sites are part of Iran’s effort to create a national internet, said Rashidi: a skeleton version of the web that is significantly more restricted than even China’s, managed by the government and virtually unconnected to the outside world. That effort has been under way since the Rouhani administration, and now appears to be working, he said.What this could mean, said Madory and Rashidi, is that Iran’s internet as it was may not come back.“There are rumours,” said Rashidi. “Some people are saying that if things go back normal, there won’t be the internet. There will be only the national internet.”“They’re gearing up for the long run, for this to be the way things are for an extended period of time,” said Madory."

        "content": "Google’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.Alphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.The spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.As tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at riskRead moreThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.Google, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.Meanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.The company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.In the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition."

I’ve been a consumer journalist for decades, and as well as air fryers, I’ve tested air-frying health grills and ovens, multi-cookers that can air fry, and everything in between. Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen. Hang around me long enough and I’ll fill you in on what air fryers can do, how they work, common issues, and how many I’ve tested over the years (about 50).How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes.’ Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBy now, you must have worked out that I take testing air fryers very seriously. My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes – which was just as tedious as it sounds. The internet is awash with hacks for peeling potatoes, including everything from worktop gadgets to peeling hot pre-boiled potatoes with your hands – and even (and I’m not making this up) power drills and toilet brushes in a bucket. I decided a sharp peeler was the best choice.Each air fryer was run empty from cold for one hour at 200C to rate its power use. Where available, I followed the manufacturer’s instructions for cooking chips. This is because the guidance is often based on the air fryer’s capabilities. Where there was none, I defaulted to 24 minutes at 200C. The same was true for onion rings – if there was a similar frozen food, I followed the suggested times and temperatures; if not, I chose 18 minutes at 200C.View image in fullscreenFrying tonight: the chips were scrutinised on their colour, crisp and crunch. Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAny food that looked at risk of burning was removed before it did so, meaning one or two cycles were ended early. Finished food was assessed on appearance (colour and texture), crisp and crunch, and the consistency of the batch (such as whether some items were less brown than others).The 12 machines I tested for this article are either recognisably an air fryer or an air fryer grill. I haven’t tested compact ovens or multi-cookers that air fry because they don’t offer the same experience, such as the ability to shake or turn the contents quickly, and they often don’t have removable parts that are easy to clean.The best air fryers in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen.’ Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest air fryer overall: Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0TefalEasy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0from £178£199.99 at Tefal£178 at AmazonWhat we loveA stellar performance coupled with cooking flexibilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit of a worktop hog, so make some room Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£199.99 at Tefal£178 at AmazonGiven that Tefal is behind the pioneering Actifry, it comes as no surprise that the Easy Fry Dual XXL is a fantastic all-rounder, excelling at both making chips and handling frozen food. It’s also Tefal’s largest double-drawer air fryer, providing a generous capacity for families and entertaining, and it has the company’s 15-year repairability commitment to cut waste.Why we love itWhile I remain unconvinced of Tefal’s claim that this air fryer’s 11-litre capacity will cater for eight to 10 people – perhaps if they’re not very hungry – it ticks almost every box, making it my choice for the best air fryer overall. There’s a good temperature range of 40-200C, programs for common foods, and the drawers and plates are dishwasher-safe and feel robust.More importantly, it performed excellently during testing, with the only head-scratcher being its recommendation for chips at 180C for 45 minutes, which was too long. After only 35 minutes, some chips were already slightly overdone, but the overall result was lovely and crisp.

So if you love marinated chicken wings or a medium steak, this is the air fryer for you. The presets can be constrictive – for example, the fries preset is designed only for frozen chips – but there is a manual mode for more confident cooks.In testing, onion rings emerged perfectly crisp after only 12 minutes, the deep drawer accommodating 11 of them, and fresh chips were near perfect with consistent browning, crunch and bubbling. My only issue was that the touchscreen wasn’t always responsive with a light touch – but this might be a plus for those who dislike oversensitive screens.It’s a shame that … the drawer isn’t dishwasher safe, so some of the time you save with presets will be spent cleaning.Size: 22.8 x 39.9 x 28.2cm (WDH)Capacity: 5 litresPower draw: 0.606kWh = 16p an hour Dishwasher safe: noPrograms: chicken, fries, fish, prawns, cupcake, steak, manualTowerAirX AI Digital Air Fryerfrom £79£79 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerWhat we loveIts colour screen and presets make it easier to programWhat we don’t loveOutside of the presets, there isn’t much guidanceBest single-drawer air fryer: Lakeland Slimline air fryerLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom £89.99£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by hand Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonIf you don’t have much counter space and don’t want to compromise on capacity, Lakeland’s slimline model is a good choice. There’s adequate flat space inside for family-size meals, or up to 1.3kg of chips, plus an internal light and a clear window to check on dinner.Why we love itI felt this air fryer was great value for money, with a good cooking capacity for its price, and it was economical to run. Its slimline shape meant food could be spread out, and I was pleased with the results of testing. Chips were golden brown, crisp at the ends and fluffy in the middle, and the batch was consistent overall, while onion rings were pleasingly crunchy. I found the window redundant once it became greasy, but it could be useful for less oily foods. I also wasn’t keen on the button that needed to be depressed to open the drawer – but it might keep curious fingers away from harm.It’s a shame that … its lowest temperature is 80C, so you won’t be dehydrating or proving dough.Size: 27.7 x 42 x 29cm (WDH) Capacity: 8 litresPower draw: 0.674kWh = 18p an hour Dishwasher safe: no, hand-wash onlyPrograms: fries, seafood, steak, fish, chicken wings, pizza, bakeLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom £89.99£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by handBest air fryer for chips: Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom £189.99£189.99 at Currys£189.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchens Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£189.99 at Currys£189.99 at AmazonOne of only a few air fryers that can also steam your food, the 5000 Series is particularly suitable if you want to trim fat from your diet – or if you dislike the dry textures that result from overcooking. Introducing steam into the mix means it’s possible to air fry, steam or use a combination of both for moist meats, bakes and reheated leftovers.Why we love itThis double air fryer offers a lot of versatility, and I felt it was the best air fryer for chips. It’s well built, feels robust and is easy to keep clean even without a dishwasher, thanks to the self-clean mode that uses steam to loosen debris. Programming can be puzzling at first – especially as you’ll need to download its manual rather than getting one in the box – but the food it cooked made up for it: crisp, perfectly browned onion rings and chips with a moreish crunch, fluffy interior and pretty consistent browning throughout. It’s frustrating that only the six-litre drawer steams, the three-litre one being limited to air frying, but you’re sure to get plenty of use out of both.It’s a shame that … if you live in a hard-water area, you’ll need to descale this air fryer to keep it in tip-top condition.Size: 49 x 39 x 40cm (WDH)Capacity: 9 litresPower draw: 0.79kWh = 21p an hour Dishwasher safe: yesPrograms: fresh fries, frozen fries, chicken, meat, veggies, fish, cake, reheatPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom £189.99£189.99 at Currys£189.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchensBest two-in-one air fryer: Caso Design AirFry DuoChefCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom £139£139.99 at Caso Design£139 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best results£139.99 at Caso Design£139 at AmazonShort on countertop space? Caso Design’s DuoChef is a twin-drawer air fryer that can turn into a small oven. Think of it like a robot-to-car Transformer: slide out the divider that sits between the two drawers, attach an oven door, and you have another appliance altogether.As well as performing double duty, the DuoChef is packed with handy features. There’s an interior light, windows on each air fryer drawer for checking progress, a shake reminder, and a hold function so that both drawers finish cooking at the same time.Why we love itBeyond its transforming capabilities, the best thing about the DuoChef is how easy it is to program. While some dual-drawer models can leave you scratching your head, here there are just three buttons for selecting the left or right drawer or both.However, while it crisped up onion rings nicely in the allotted time, fresh fries were another matter entirely. After 25 minutes, the potato was still quite pale, with only light browning, and required another five minutes’ cooking time to reach any kind of crispiness.It’s a shame that … it’s pretty slow at whipping up chips compared with the other models on test.Size: 43.5 x 38.5x 33.5cm (WDH) Capacity: 11 litres (14 litres as an oven)Power draw: 0.971kWh = 26p an hourDishwasher safe: yesPrograms: fries, steak, chicken, bacon, fish, vegetables, pizza, cakes, root vegetables, reheatCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom £139£139.99 at Caso Design£139 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best resultsBest air fryer grill: ProCook air fryer health grillProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to store Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£129 at ProCookIf you find the flat cooking space of some air fryers restrictive, you can spread your (chicken) wings with ProCook’s air fryer health grill. It comes with a 4.5-litre cooking pot and basket for air frying, as well as accessories to turn it into a slow-cooking and steaming kitchen helper.Why we love itAir fryer grills aren’t always the most convenient for making chips from scratch, because you can’t quickly shake a drawer for even results. However, with the toss of a spatula, the ProCook ensured great consistency throughout its batch of chips. They emerged crisp at the ends and golden overall, with no pieces that overcooked and only one or two paler chips. Onion rings were crunchy and nothing stuck to the basket. My only niggle was that the settings could be confusing for a first-time user: once you’ve altered them to suit and hit start, the display shows the program’s default settings instead while it preheats.It’s a shame that … I found cleaning the basket and cooking pot a chore: it comes with its own brush for tackling greasy residue, and you will need to use it.Size: 40 x 40 x 28cm (WDH)Capacity: 4.5 litresPower draw: 0.83kWh = 22p an hourDishwasher safe: no (basket and pot)Programs: air fry, roast, broil, bake, dehydrate, slow cook, grill, griddle, stew, steam, keep warm, manualProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to storeBest compact air fryer: Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryerNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom £188.74£199.99 at Ninja£188.74 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in use Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£199.99 at Ninja£188.74 at AmazonNo article about air fryers would be complete without Ninja, which has given the world models in all shapes and sizes – most notably its stacked designs. The Double Stack XL offers capacity without a huge worktop footprint, thanks to its twin 4.75-litre drawers and a pair of racks that double its flat area, allowing you to cook four layers of food. Ideal for families, newbies and those struggling to squeeze in an air fryer.Why we love itNinja’s air fryers always come packed with guidance and recipes, and the Double Stack XL is no exception. These serve to underline how versatile it is: you could cook two whole chickens at the same time, for example – great if your barbecue’s rained off. It’s incredibly easy to program and adjust as it cooks – and the top temperature of 240C is perfect for crisping food from the freezer. That said, some of its recommended times and temperatures might be a bit off. After 26 minutes at 200C, some chips were still pale and soft, which suggests they’d need longer. There were similar results from the onion rings, which after 18 minutes didn’t have the crisp and crunch produced by the other machines.It’s a shame that … its results didn’t impress me as much as Ninja’s other air fryers have – you may need to tweak settings.Size: 28 x 47 x 38.5cm (WDH)Capacity: 9.5 litresPower draw: 1.049kWh = 28p an hourDishwasher safe: yes – but hand-washing recommended to extend lifespanPrograms: air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, dehydrate, reheatNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom £188.74£199.99 at Ninja£188.74 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in useThe best of the restView image in fullscreenThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone, Tower Vortx Colour, Salter Fuzion and Russell Hobbs SatisFry multi-cooker.

Or perhaps you crave crispy chips but have doubts about BPA, Teflon or Pfas? If so, there’s the Fritaire. Equipped with a stainless-steel grill stand, rotating tumbler for fries and a rotisserie for chicken, it looks as if a halogen cooker and an air fryer got together and had a baby. Plus, there’s a choice of bright colours for those who can’t stand black.There’s much here to like – a “self-cleaning” function that keeps the glass bowl from becoming greasy, good visibility to check progress, and if you’re using the tumbler, no need to shake fries – but there are downsides. I found the display hard to read in bright light, and the tumbler capacity is only 500g: loading it with chips was awkward compared with tossing them in a drawer. Plus, while onion rings emerged crisp and brown from the stand, the chips were anything but. While the batch was consistent, the chips were mostly soft and slightly chewy.It didn’t make the final cut because … the exterior grows extremely hot during cooking, and stays hot for some time after.Size: 35 x 26 x 31cm (WDH); capacity: 4.7 litres (0.5kg max capacity of food using stand/tumbler); power draw: 0.65kWh = 17p an hour; dishwasher safe: yes, accessories only; programs: french fries, steak, chicken, seafood, bake, dehydrateFritaireThe self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerfrom £154£154 at Peter Tyson Electricals£159 at B&QWhat we loveIt’s seriously stylish and looks fab lit upWhat we don’t loveIt’s not nearly as convenient as a standard model Salter Fuzion dual air fryerSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best results Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£99 at AsdaBest for: families on a budgetIf you’re feeding many mouths, you’ll need a big air fryer. Salter’s Fuzion offers a lot of space at an affordable price – and thanks to the eight-litre drawer’s divider, you can air fry two foods at the same time. Alternatively, with the divider in place, you can just use half the air fryer: perfect for snacks. However, like other air fryers with dividers, it has issues with shaking: both types of food will be tossed around, and larger drawers are harder to shake.I was disappointed with the level of browning on the chips and found that the onion rings weren’t quite as crisp as they should be. Keeping its clear window grease-free may be a challenge, too.It didn’t make the final cut because … the drawer doesn’t feel as durable as it should be for this type of air fryer: its metal is thin enough to flex.Size: 36.4 x 38 x 32cm (WDH); capacity: 8 litres; power draw: 0.912kWh = 24p an hour; dishwasher safe: no; programs: manual, chips, shellfish, steak, pork, bake, chicken, vegetablesSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best results Instant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom £169£169 at John Lewis£169.99 at LakelandWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than this Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£169 at John Lewis£169.99 at LakelandBest for: confident air fryer cooksI’m afraid Instant Pot commits one of my air fryer cardinal sins with its Vortex Plus VersaZone: there’s no instructions or guidance in the box, but simply a QR code that directs you to videos – I’m not a fan of forcing tech into the kitchen. The Instant Pot was also one of the trickiest to program (for example, you have to switch from single drawer to dual by holding its control knob), so it’s probably not a good choice for air fryer newbies.There are some good things here, though: two 4.2-litre compartments with a divider, the ability to switch to fahrenheit, and the option to turn off the beeps if they annoy. It also produced great results, and perhaps that’s the most important thing: plenty of crispy chips – though not consistently so – and crunchy, well-browned onion rings.It didn’t make the final cut because … the display is busy and hard to read in bright light.Size: 31.4 x 38.4 x 40.4cm (WDH); capacity: 8.5 litres; power draw: 1.187kWh = 31p an hour; dishwasher safe: yes; programs: air fry, roast, bake, grill, dehydrate, reheatInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom £169£169 at John Lewis£169.99 at LakelandWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than this Russell Hobbs SatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom £119.99£119.99 at Currys£165 at ArgosWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batches Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£119.99 at Currys£165 at ArgosBest for: small householdsIf you’re unsure about how much you might use an air fryer and so want an appliance that does more to earn its place on the worktop, the compact SatisFry could suit. It may stretch the definition of a multi-cooker somewhat, lacking some of the functions you might associate with one, but its spacious pot can be used for air frying and other tasks, including slow cooking and searing.There’s not much guidance, however, and the results were mixed: chips were browned but soft and not very crisp, while onion rings were doughy with some singeing. I suspect both could have benefited from different times and temperatures. The other downside is that it recommends no more than 800g at a time for air frying, so you won’t be able to use all its space for this function.It didn’t make the final cut because … it’s not the easiest to program: for example, there are no separate up and down buttons for time and temperature.Size: 37.8 x 32 x 28.2cm (WDH); capacity: 5.5 litres; power draw: 0.550kWh = 14p an hour; dishwasher safe: yes; programs: air fry, bake, grill, keep warm, roast, sear, slow cook high/lowRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom £119.99£119.99 at Currys£165 at ArgosWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batchesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenYour air fryer should be able to cook almost anything your oven can. Photograph: Grace Cary/Getty ImagesWhat can I cook in an air fryer?While air fryers have gained a reputation for turning out perfect homemade chips and crispy food from the freezer, they’re capable of far more. Not only can you “boil” eggs, prove dough and make yoghurt (if your model offers lower temperatures), you should be able to cook almost anything your oven can. As a rough guide, for oven recipes, set your air fryer temperature 20C lower (so if a recipe states 200C fan, set your air fryer to 180C). Air fryers also cook more quickly than an oven. The time can be reduced by as much as a quarter, so check food often to prevent burning.You can press your air fryer into service for every meal of the day. Try sesame and pine nut air fryer granola for breakfast, a light lunch of crisp chickpea, courgette and tomato salad, followed by prepare-ahead lamb koftas with tahini sauce for dinner and a dessert of apple and cinnamon “pan” cake. Busy day? Curl up with air fryer chicken wings with baby potatoes for a tasty supper or a sweet treat snack of glazed chouxnuts.What features should my air fryer have?A good-quality air fryer is an investment, so check its programs, ease of cleaning and temperature/time range before you buy. There’s no need for the lower temperatures and long durations (usually up to 12 hours) for dehydrating fruit and fermenting yoghurt if you’ll mostly be using it for air frying, for example. Similarly, if you’re a keen cook, look for one with plenty of space – a small air fryer may soon limit your horizons.For those with a dishwasher, check that drawers and crisping plates are safe to clean this way, while if you’re cleaning by hand, robust nonstick coatings will make degreasing easier.The best kettles to save energy and speed up your cuppa, testedRead moreHow do air fryers work?Air fryers are best thought of as smaller, modified convection ovens with a fast fan. Rather than having the fan and element at the rear, these are above, producing powerful fanned heat that’s circulated around the drawer.Food sits on a perforated crisper plate, allowing heat to reach the underside, while a thin layer of oil on the surface “fries” the exterior to create browning and crunch. Shaking the contents in the drawer roughens up the surface, creating more area for crisping.Are air fryers healthier than regular frying?Yes, both because you need a lower amount of oil – a tablespoon should be enough to coat a 500g batch of chipped potato, while other foods require no oil at all – but also because the way food is “fried” is different.Conventional frying uses the oil in the pan to seal the exterior. This prevents moisture from escaping, which is then heated, steaming the inside. To do this, oil penetrates the food’s surface, meaning that more fat is retained than when air frying.Are air fryers ‘toxic’?Linger on social media long enough and you’ll find worries about air fryer toxicity. It’s usually centred on plastic parts growing hot (which, as it’s limited to the exterior of air fryers, rather than the parts that come into contact with food, shouldn’t present a problem) and nonstick coatings containing Pfas/PFOA.Most manufacturers have phased out PFOA (since 2013, all Teflon products have been PFOA-free), while potential deterioration of nonstick (which may use Pfas as this is a term for a large group of chemicals) tends to happen at temperatures of 260C and above. Most air fryers have a limit of 200C, with the top temperatures on others 240C.If you’re concerned about the safety of nonstick, choose an air fryer with a ceramic-coated pan and plates, or clean yours carefully: damaged coatings are more likely to release chemicals.Another concern linked to air fryers is about cooking starchy food, which produces acrylamide (a potential carcinogen). However, the same risks apply when oven-cooking food.Cooking oil at high temperatures can also produce potentially harmful compounds. Air fryers don’t use much oil, but if you’re concerned about this, choose an oil with a high smoke point (the temperature at which oil starts to smoke and break down), such as vegetable, peanut, sunflower or rapeseed.Do air fryers use less energy than an oven?Air fryers have gained a reputation for being economical, and while this is true for the most part, it won’t always be the case. For small amounts of food, air fryers use less energy, heating up quickly and only circulating hot air within a small space. An example, a A+-rated 72-litre oven might use 1.395kWh to cook a roast chicken over 90 minutes, while an air fryer could do the same job in less than an hour and use only 0.782kWh – almost half the energy and cost.However, if you were cooking large amounts, such as a whole roast dinner – chicken, roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding, roast veggies and so on – running several cycles of air frying would cost more, making an oven the more energy-efficient choice.The best rice cookers for gloriously fluffy grains at home: nine tried and tested favouritesRead moreWhat can I do with my old air fryer?Whether you’ve upgraded from a compact model to a bigger appliance or your air fryer is no longer sizzling as it should, you may be wondering what to do with it.If it’s broken, you can recycle it.

A new feature called Conversate shows contextual information (such as floating information about a famous person or place) in the middle of conversations.A new charging mechanism allows you to just pop them in a case, and an optional smart ring, the R1, can be used to control the glasses and track health data.Even RealitiesG2 smart glasses$599$599 at Even RealitiesAnker Nano 45W Charger with Smart Display AnkerNano 45W Charger with Smart Display$39.99$39.99 at Anker Photograph: Prakhar Khanna/The Guardian Photograph: Prakhar Khanna/The Guardian$39.99 at AnkerAs a frequent traveler, I’m stoked for the release of this powerful and pocketable new charger with a built-in display that shows your charging speed, phone battery level, and temperature in real time.

        "content": "The best Apple Watch may be the one already on your wrist.Each generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.While several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.At a glance\n \n  Best Apple Watch for most people:SE 3\nFrom £219 at Apple\n \n  Best mid-range Apple Watch: \n   Series 11\nFrom £369 at Apple\n \n  Best Apple Watch for battery: \n   Ultra 3\nFrom £729 at CurrysWhy you should trust meI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.How I testedView image in fullscreenTesting the Apple Watch SE 3. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.We change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.We test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.The best Apple Watches you can buy in 2026View image in fullscreenThe Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for an iPhone with apps and full integration with iOS. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest Apple Watch for most people: SE 3AppleSE 3from £219£219 at Apple£219 at John LewisWhat we loveOffers a lot of Apple Watch for the moneyWhat we don’t loveSkimps on heart health features Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £219 at Apple£219 at John LewisThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.It’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.The big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.The SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.While you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.It tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.Note that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.Why should you buy it?The SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.Don’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.Read our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhoneSize: 40/44mmThickness: 10.7mmScreen brightness: up to 1,000nitsTested battery life: 1.5 daysProcessor: S10Storage: 64GBWater resistance: 50 metres Sensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPSAppleSE 3from £219£219 at Apple£219 at John LewisWhat we loveOffers a lot of Apple Watch for the moneyWhat we don’t loveSkimps on heart health featuresBest mid-range Apple Watch: Series 11AppleSeries 11from £369£369 at Apple£369 at AmazonWhat we loveFull heart health, fitness and activity trackingWhat we don’t loveLooks practically the same as all older models Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £369 at AppleFrom £369 at AmazonThe latest standard Apple Watch is the Series 11, which comes in 42mm and 46mm sizes in a more refined design. It’s just 9.7mm thick to slide more easily under cuffs than the other models. It’s available in aluminium or titanium, in multiple different colours and finishes, with plenty of strap options for those who want to switch.The Series 11 has everything the SE 3 does: the latest S10 chip, 64GB of storage and watchOS 26 with all the trimmings, including the excellent double-tap and wrist-flick gestures. But it has longer battery life, lasting a solid two days between charges for general use, or up to eight hours of workout tracking with GPS. It charges in just over an hour via its magnetic charging puck, hitting 70% in 30 minutes.The bigger and brighter display of the Series 11 has slimmer bezels and curved edges that better blend into the body for a sleeker look overall. Plus, it’s protected by significantly more-scratch-resistant glass or super-hard sapphire, depending on the model, to keep it looking good for longer. The screen is also brighter, which makes the always-on display easier to see from an angle, particularly useful during workouts, when you might not be viewing it face on.Also included is Apple’s full health-monitoring suite, including ECG and blood oxygen monitoring, and the recently added hypertension alerts that look for signs of high blood pressure over 30-day periods. For heart health, this is the Apple Watch to choose. The Series 11 also has a depth gauge that works down to six metres and a water temperature sensor for swimming, but you’ll need the Ultra model if you want to go diving.Why should you buy it?The Series 11 offers the best Apple Watch experience in the slimmest and nicest-looking body, with a gorgeous screen and two days of battery life. You also get the full suite of health-tracking tools with ECG, blood oxygen and hypertension alerts.Don’t buy if: you want the longest battery life or a more rugged design.Read our full Apple Watch Series 11 review: wrist-flickingly good with longer battery lifeSize: 42/46mmThickness: 9.7mmScreen brightness: up to 2,000nitsTested battery life: 2 daysProcessor: S10Storage: 64GBWater resistance: 50 metres Sensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, GPSAppleSeries 11from £369£369 at Apple£369 at AmazonWhat we loveFull heart health, fitness and activity trackingWhat we don’t loveLooks practically the same as all older modelsBest Apple Watch for battery: Ultra 3AppleUltra 3from £729£729 at Currys£749 at AppleWhat we loveLonger battery life of up to three daysWhat we don’t loveVery expensive for an Apple Watch Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £729 at CurrysFrom £749 at AppleThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.It’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.On the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.On the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.The Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.Size-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.Why should you buy it?The Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.Don’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.Read our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhoneSize: 49mmThickness: 12mm Screen brightness: up to 3,000nitsTested battery life: 3 daysProcessor: S10Storage: 64GBWater resistance: 100 metres Sensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPSAppleUltra 3from £729£729 at Currys£749 at AppleWhat we loveLonger battery life of up to three daysWhat we don’t loveVery expensive for an Apple WatchOther optionsView image in fullscreenApple Watch Series Ultra 2 and Series 9 are still worth buying refurbished or at a discount. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSeries 10 \n  The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.Series 9 \n  Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.Ultra 2 \n  2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.Replace or spruce up?Wearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.Greater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.There are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.Several third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.Make sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:Grade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.Grade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.Grade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.Once you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:Battery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?Charging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.Buttons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.Sensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?Speakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.Wifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.Water resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?Warranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?Do not buyAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.For more:\n    The best running watches – tested\n    The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to expertsSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor"

        "content": "Google’s third-generation folding phone promises to be more durable than all others as the first with full water and dust resistance while also packing lots of advanced AI and an adaptable set of cameras.The Pixel 10 Pro Fold builds on last year’s excellent 9 Pro Fold by doing away with gears in the hinge along its spine allowing it to deal with dust, which has been the achilles heel of all foldable phones until now, gumming up the works in a way that just isn’t a problem for regular slab phones.But, as with all foldable phones, the Pixel is very expensive, costing £1,749 (€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699), sitting far above the £1,199 Pixel 10 Pro XL and rubbing shoulders with the equally pricey Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.View image in fullscreenGoogle says the new gearless hinge of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is capable of surviving more than 10 years of folding. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianImproved durability aside, not a lot has visibly changed on the outside since the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The external screen is a smidgen larger thanks to thinner bezels, and the inside and outside screens are slightly brighter than before. The Fold is a great shape when closed for phone-based tasks and can comfortably fit two full-size apps side by side on the excellent internal screen when open.However, the Pixel is heavy and looks chunky compared with Samsung’s impressively thin and light Z Fold 7. It is 258g, which you can feel in use and the pocket, while being significantly thicker than a normal phone and the latest rivals.View image in fullscreenQi2 charging support in the back opens up compatibility with a wide variety of magnetic accessories, including the excellent Twelve South Curve Nano stand (left) and the QDOS SnapStand Qi2 charger (right). Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 line with 16GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage. It performs just as well as the Pixel 10 Pro, feeling rapid in use and capable of handling most tasks without breaking a sweat. Those seeking the highest frame rates in high-end games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, however.As with all foldables, the battery life of the Fold varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. On light days with about five hours of active screen use spread equally between the inside and outside displays, mostly on wifi, the Pixel managed about 38 to 40 hours between charges. On heavier days on 5G with more inside screen use, it lasted about 28 hours, ending the day with 25% left in the tank. That’s not terrible but is some way behind the best rivals or big-screen slab phones, including the Pixel 10 Pro XL.View image in fullscreenA full charge takes 90 minutes, hitting 50% in 30 minutes with a 30W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included). It also supports 15W Qi2 wireless charging.

Tapping it brings the app back into full view. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold runs the same Android 16 software as the rest of the Pixel 10 Pro line, which introduces a bold and colourful appearance plus lots of cutting-edge AI tools crammed into almost every corner of the phone.Some of the highlights include the Gemini chatbot, which can see and hear what you do, interact with your apps and is generally quite useful, plus a new real-time translation system for phone calls that replicates the caller’s voice.Magic Cue is the standout feature, which is a little helper that runs in the background on your device, processing your data from various Google apps and popping up with timely information when you need it. It understands context, so when a friend texts to ask about when your flight lands it will suggest your flight details from your calendar so you can paste them straight into your conversation, or when you call a business it will show your order details from Gmail right in the phone app. It is low-key great.It also has a few modifications to make the most of the big internal screen. A task bar at the bottom of the display makes putting apps into split screen easy. You can also resize apps beyond the border of the screen, similar to the Honor Magic V5 and OnePlus Open, which adds a bit of flexibility to running two apps side by side.The Fold also comes with a subscription for Google AI Pro for a year, worth £19 a month, granting access to more powerful Gemini AI models and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email. The phone will receive updates until October 2032.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium frame feels high quality and solid. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery is rated to last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair with manuals and parts due to be available.The Pixel 10 Pro Fold contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app has multiple modes but it is easiest to shoot photos with the Pixel closed like a regular phone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 10 Pro Fold has a very similar camera set up to last year’s 9 Pro Fold and the new Pixel 10, including a 48-megapixel main, 10.5MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera, which out-zooms folding phone rivals, plus two 10MP selfie cameras.The main camera shoots good photos across a range of conditions, although it can suffer from a little blur and grain at lower light levels. Google’s night mode is still the best in the business when it gets really dark. The ultra-wide camera is solid, while the 5x optical zoom telephoto camera can meaningfully close the distance to objects. The latter can be a bit soft on detail in less than ideal light. Just like the regular Pixel 10 the camera shoots good photos and video most will be pleased with, but it can’t match the Pixel 10 Pro line, which for this price you might expect.The Fold has a few tricks of its own, including various shooting modes using both screens or propped up at angles when partly folded, plus the ability to shoot selfies with the main camera. The handy Made You Look feature shows an animation on the outside screen that reacts when your child looks its way and smiles, keeping their attention long enough for you to shoot a photo, although unfortunately it uses one of the selfie cameras, not the primary camera, so it’s more for fun than a great photo.PriceThe Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs from £1,749 (€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699).For comparison, the Pixel 10 costs £799, Pixel 10 Pro costs £999, the Pixel 10 Pro XL costs £1,199, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs £1,799 and the Honor Magic V5 costs £1,699.99.VerdictThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is a minor update to the already good 9 Pro Fold from last year, but one that could have a bigger impact down the line. As the first properly dust-resistant foldable it sets a new durability benchmark, slowly bringing the devices up to par with standard slab phones.The inside screen is still necessarily softer than a regular hardened glass to allow it to fold, however, so you must still be careful with it. A fingernail can leave a permanent mark if you press hard enough.The added Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging support is just as good in the Fold as it is in other Pixels. The phone is rapid, has reasonable battery life, runs great software and has the best cutting-edge AI around. The cameras are good for a foldable, too, although can’t match the best normal phones.The Pixel does a great job of balancing being a regular phone when closed and a great tablet when open, but it is fat and heavy compared with the dramatically thinner and lighter Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n Pros: a phone and tablet in one, dust and water resistant, Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging, great tablet screen, good performance, good cameras with 5x zoom, packed with AI including Magic Cue, Google AI Pro included for a year, seven years of software updates.\n Cons: extremely expensive, more fragile and costlier to repair than a regular device, thick and heavy, cameras can’t match regular Pixel 10 Pro, battery life could be better, fewer power-user features than rivals.\nView image in fullscreenThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is about the same width and height as a regular phone when closed.

        "content": "It may not look as different as the redesigned Pro models this year or be as wafer thin as the new iPhone Air, but the iPhone 17 marks a big year for the standard Apple smartphone.That’s because Apple has finally brought one of the best features of modern smartphones to its base-model flagship phone: a super-smooth 120Hz screen.And it has done so, while also doubling the starting storage, without increasing the price. The iPhone 17 still starts at the same £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) as its predecessor, sitting below the £999 Air and £1,099 Pro, while offering a lot of iPhone for the money.From the outside it doesn’t look as if anything has changed since the iPhone 16, but the 17 is ever so slightly taller to squeeze in the bigger screen with slimmer borders without making the phone materially larger. The 6.3in screen now matches the super-bright display on the 17 Pro covered with significantly toughened glass to better resist scratches.View image in fullscreenA new anti-glare coating on the display makes it a lot easier to see and use the screen outside in bright, direct sunlight. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 120Hz “Pro Motion” tech is the best bit, doubling the refresh rate of the screen to make scrolling and animations much smoother and more responsive. It has been a feature common to rival smartphones for years, but Apple has until this point reserved it for Pro models of the iPhone, MacBooks and iPads.The 17 also has the previously Pro-only always-on display feature, which shows the time, widgets and notifications while the phone is idle. And it runs the same iOS 26 with Apple’s new glass-like interface design as the rest of the iPhone lineup. It looks a bit different and some elements have been simplified or condensed to get out of the way of the content you’re trying to see, but generally it works the same with some nice touches here and there.Specifications\n \n  Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)\n \n  Processor: Apple A19\n \n  RAM: 8GB\n \n  Storage: 256 or 512GB\n \n  Operating system: iOS 26\n \n  Camera: 48MP main + 48MP UW; 18MP front-facing\n \n  Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS\n \n  Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)\n \n  Dimensions: 149.6 x 71.5 x 7.95mm\n \n  Weight: 177g\nRapid A19 chip and solid battery lifeView image in fullscreenThe phone fully charges in 82 minutes using a 20W or greater USB-C power adapter (not included), hitting 50% in 21 minutes. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone 17 has Apple’s new A19 chip, which is only a little less powerful than the A19 Pro in the other models this year, making it one of the fastest chips in a smartphone. Apple still has a lead over Android rivals in processors, even in cheaper models.As a result the 17 handles everything you could want to do with a phone with aplomb. Battery life is also good for a phone of this size, lasting a solid 44 hours of mixed usage across wifi and 5G between charges, actively using the screen for about six hours and with the always-on display feature turned on. That’s slightly shorter than its predecessor, but slightly longer than the similarly sized 17 Pro and a fair bit longer than the iPhone Air. Most people will need to charge the 17 every other day.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe smooth recycled aluminium body and matt glass back feel solid and premium without a case. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349.The phone contains more than 30% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down its environmental impact in a report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app has been simplified by hiding more of the features behind a sliding selector and pop-out menus to make more room for the viewfinder. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 17 has two 48-megapixel cameras on the back – one main and one ultrawide – plus Apple’s new 18MP centre stage selfie camera, as seen on the iPhone 17 Pro and Air.The main camera remains unchanged from the iPhone 16 and shoots great photos across a range of lighting conditions. Occasionally it can be blown out by bright lights or suffer from a bit of blur or grain in low-light conditions, but it is a reliably good point-and-shoot camera. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which works great in good light and OK in dimmer indoor lighting. The ultrawide is an upgrade on predecessors, shooting with greater detail and range. It works particularly well for the macro mode for closeup photos.The camera can digitally zoom up 10x, but the resulting photos lack detail and sharpness. A real camera zoom is still limited to the Pro models on an iPhone.The new front-facing camera shoots solid selfies, which are slightly better than previous iPhones. But its party piece is the ability to automatically pan and zoom to fit everyone in for group shots, no matter which orientation you hold the phone. Shooting landscape photos while holding your phone in portrait is surprisingly useful.The 17 has plenty of modes to play about with and shoots great video, including a dual-capture feature that records from the front and back cameras at the same time to put the photographer into the shot in a little window.PriceThe iPhone 17 starts from £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro costs £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 costs £699 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499.VerdictThe iPhone 17 may not look all that different from last year’s model, but it is a meaningful upgrade on all the standard model iPhones that have come before.That’s because it has key features pulled down from Apple’s pricier Pro models, including a significantly better, brighter and 120Hz-smooth screen. It’s a must-have feature that has been standard on rival phones for years. The always-on display is super handy too, while double the starting storage to 256GB and about two-day battery life is very welcome. For the first time in many years, using the iPhone 17 doesn’t feel like a significant downgrade from the Pro models.The dual camera on the back is good, but the lack of a telephoto option keeps it from being great. The iPhone 17 still feels compact for a modern phone, and while not quite as featherlight as the iPhone Air, it isn’t exactly heavy.Unless you need a camera zoom, the standard iPhone 17 is the one to get for Apple buyers. It’s great.\n Pros: rapid, great 120Hz screen, good dual camera with macro mode, at least 256GB storage, great size, action and camera control buttons, USB-C, good battery life, long software support, Face ID.\n Cons: no telephoto camera, samey design, not the thinnest, lightest or most powerful model.\nView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 17 is the last remaining iPhone with a simple two-camera setup on the back in vertical alignment, meaning it doesn’t stand out as much as other models.

        "content": "The iPhone Air is a technical and design marvel that asks: how much are you willing to give up for a lightweight and ultra-slender profile?Beyond the obvious engineering effort that has gone into creating one of the slimmest phones ever made, the Air is a reductive exercise that boils down the iPhone into the absolute essentials in a premium body.Cut away the rear cameras, slim down the battery, remove the stereo speakers and maximise the screen, and what is left is an impressive sliver of titanium and glass.Doing so isn’t cheap. The iPhone Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799), sitting in between the standard £799 iPhone 17 and the £1,099 17 Pro models.View image in fullscreenThe Air’s slim lines are slightly betrayed by the plateau and camera lens that protrude from the back, doubling the phone’s thickness to about 11.3mm, reminiscent of Google’s Pixel bar. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianPhotos don’t do the Air justice. You know it is something special as soon as you pick it up. Its 5.64mm-thick frame feels thinner thanks to soft edges and light weight that’s 12g less than the already quite light iPhone 17.The glass lump on the back contains most of the guts of the phone with the rest dedicated to the battery. The usual iPhone buttons line the sides including the camera control and action buttons. The earpiece speaker in the top is the only one: it is pretty good but you can tell there’s no stereo sound when watching videos, which is a bit of a shame as the 6.5in screen is smooth, bright and fantastic.The Air behaves just like any other modern iPhone. It runs iOS 26 with its glass-like design, has all the same apps, Face ID and is super responsive. There is only one hiccup and that’s the lack of a nano sim card tray, as the iPhone Air relies entirely on eSim. In the US Apple has only supported eSims since the iPhone 14, but models sold everywhere else had nano sim slots, until the Air.View image in fullscreenThe sides of the phone are only a little thicker than the buttons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianMost of the major networks in the UK can provide eSims, but the experience of setting it up or moving between phones isn’t great for all of them and not all budget providers support them. The mobile networks have some work to do to make eSims a good experience everywhere.Specifications\n \n  Screen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)\n \n  Processor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU)\n \n  RAM: 12GB\n \n  Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\n \n  Operating system: iOS 26\n \n  Camera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing\n \n  Connectivity: 5G eSim-only, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, satellite, UWB and GNSS\n \n  Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)\n \n  Dimensions: 156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mm\n \n  Weight: 165g\nA19 Pro chipView image in fullscreenThe Air takes about 105 minutes to fully charge, hitting 60% in 35 minutes using a 20W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included). Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Air has the A19 Pro chip similar to the iPhone 17 Pro, but with one fewer GPU core, reducing its performance a little for games and other graphics-intensive tasks. It feels rapid in daily tasks but gets noticeably warmer by the camera lump when doing intensive jobs.Despite most of the body being dedicated to the battery, a smaller capacity cell is the Air’s first big concession to slenderness. The battery life is shorter than other iPhones, but isn’t as bad as you might imagine. For relatively light days with the screen actively used for five hours for browsing, messaging and watching video mostly on wifi, the Air lasted a decent 40 hours between charges.View image in fullscreenQi2 or MagSafe magnetic wireless chargers, such as the Twelve South PowerBug, are likely to make living with the Air easier for quick top-ups during the day. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOn heavier days, shooting photos, using mapping on 5G out and about, listening to music, messaging and watching video on the commute, the Air lasted about 30 hours, ending the day with roughly 25% left. It should see out most days with a nightly charge, but if you do lots of gaming or other more intensive tasks you may need low power mode.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe slender frame still contains a fairly easy-to-replace battery, which may be needed after about 1,000 charge cycles. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349.

The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera behaves the same as most iPhones, but the lack of ultrawide and telephoto options simplifies things a bit. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe camera is the second big concession. The Air only has a single 48-megapixel camera on the back with the new and improved 18MP selfie camera with Centre Stage tech from the iPhone 17 line on the front.The main camera matches that from the regular iPhone 17, not the larger sensor from the 17 Pro, but performs admirably. It can shoot great photos and video in good lighting and manages dim indoor light fairly well. It can look a bit soft and grainy at times and won’t win any camera awards, but generally shoots decent photos. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which is pretty good in brighter scenes, but zoom further and your photos have all the hallmarks of digital zoom: surfaces and people look a bit soft and detail is lost in more distant subjects.View image in fullscreenThe iPhone Air’s zoom is pretty good in brighter scenes but loses detail on more distant subjects. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe lack of an ultrawide and telephoto camera certainly hampers the shots you can get. The only other iPhone with a single rear camera is the lower cost iPhone 16e.The 18MP front-facing camera automatically pans and zooms to fit everyone in group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies without having to turn the phone sideways, which is a neat trick. You can also shoot video from the front and rear cameras at the same time to put the photographer in the frame in a little window.PriceThe iPhone Air costs from £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 is £799, iPhone 17 Pro is £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is £899 and the Fairphone 6 sells for £499.VerdictThe iPhone Air is a remarkable design seeking a problem to solve. I’m not sure many people have looked at their current smartphone and wished it would be thinner rather than having longer battery life and a better camera.The super-slender frame feels transformative when you first pick it up, but the novelty quickly wears off. As with Samsung’s equally thin Galaxy S25 Edge, the lighter weight is the most meaningful change making it easier to hold and pocket. The Air has a big screen but won’t weigh you down.The battery life is better than expected and should see out most days with some left in the tank when new, which may not be the case after a couple of years of use. Apple sells a smart MagSafe battery to add another 65% capacity to the Air, but slapping it on the back removes the benefit of the thin and light design. So does adding a case.The biggest concession is the single camera on the back. The lack of ultrawide and telephoto options is a cut too far for me using a phone as my primary method for capturing memories.But if you are an Apple buyer who wants a slender novelty that is great to hold and use, the iPhone Air is a special piece of hardware. For everyone else there are better options elsewhere.\n Pros: super thin and lightweight, great screen, good single rear camera, upgraded Centre Stage selfie camera, top performance, long software support, Face ID.\n Cons: no ultrawide or telephoto cameras, expensive, relatively short battery life, deserves to be used without a case, lack of cutting-edge AI.\nView image in fullscreenThe iPhone Air is impressive, looking and feeling different to the rest of the iPhone line.

It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year.View image in fullscreenHigher peak brightness and a new anti-glare coating on the screen help cut down on reflections in bright light, making it easier to use outside. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset.A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera bar on a Pixel. The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around the edges of the plateau, so a case is still prudent.View image in fullscreenThe home and lock screens of iOS 26 now have a glassy, more rounded look to text and icons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe handset runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes.Specifications\n \n  Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)\n \n  Processor: Apple A19 Pro\n \n  RAM: 12GB\n \n  Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\n \n  Operating system: iOS 26\n \n  Camera: 48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facing\n \n  Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS\n \n  Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)\n \n  Dimensions: 150 x 71.9 x 8.75mm\n \n  Weight: 204g\nFaster and cooler A19 Pro chipView image in fullscreenThe iPhone fully charges in 76 minutes via USB-C, hitting 70% in half an hour using a 40W adaptor (not included) or 96 minutes using a Qi2 25W charger such as the Belkin UltraCharge 2-in-1. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer.It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold.The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe camera plateau stops the iPhone 17 Pro rocking around on a desk as much as previous models.

Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe simplified camera app automates more of the photo-taking and hides many features behind sliding buttons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThere are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front.The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting.New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too.View image in fullscreenZooming beyond 15-20x to a max of 40x magnification, the photos have obvious signs of being blown up by digital zoom. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAll three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets.Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone.PriceThe iPhone 17 Pro costs from £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 costs £799, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,099 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499.VerdictThe 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models.The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous.But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera.That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business.So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it.\n Pros: looks different to other models, relatively compact, great cameras including 4x/8x telephoto, upgraded selfie camera, great screen, USB-C, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID.\n Cons: expensive, heavier than previous models, lack of cutting-edge AI features compared with rivals, same screen and size can be found on cheaper model."

        "content": "Apple’s entry level Watch SE has been updated with almost everything from its excellent mid-range Series 11 but costs about 40% less, making it the bargain of iPhone smartwatches.The new Watch SE 3 costs from £219 (€269/$249/A$399), making it one of the cheapest brand-new fully fledged smartwatches available for the iPhone and undercutting the £369 Series 11 and the top-of-the-line £749 Apple Watch Ultra 3.The Watch SE line is updated only every few years and has been good value but was missing some crucial things that make Apple’s other watches great. The Watch SE 3’s biggest upgrade is an always-on display, which brings it up to par with the Series line, allowing you to see the time and notifications at a glance without having to twist your wrist to turn the screen on.View image in fullscreenThe screen on and active with the flow watch face (left) and in its idle always-on position (right) with the time still visible. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe SE 3 has the older Apple Watch design from 2020’s Series 6 with smaller screens, larger bezels and a choice of 40mm or 44mm case sizes compared with the current Series watches. The screen is also not quite as bright as the more expensive watches, but that is noticeable only in bright direct sunlight. It is still sharp and good looking.The SE 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, and is just as responsive. It also has the same excellent touch-free gestures, including double tap and wrist flick, which allow you to dismiss notifications, timers and alarms easily.The watch also supports all the rest of the general Apple Watch features in watchOS 26, including Apple Pay contactless payments, rich notifications, music control, third-party apps and a range of watch faces.View image in fullscreenThe SE 3 runs all the same apps and services as its more expensive siblings. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery life of the SE 3 is a little shorter than the Series 11, lasting about a day and a half of general use, including sleep tracking overnight. Most will have to charge it every other day, particularly if they track any workouts. The SE 3 will last up to seven hours of running tracking with GPS and heart rate, which should be long enough for a marathon. A full charge using the magnetic puck takes about an hour, hitting 70% in 30 minutes.Specifications\n \n  Case size: 40mm or 44mm\n \n  Case thickness: 10.7mm\n \n  Weight: about 26g or 33g\n \n  Processor: S10\n \n  Storage: 64GB\n \n  Operating system: watchOS 26\n \n  Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM)\n \n  Sensors: HR (2nd-gen), skin temp, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter\n \n  Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, optional 5G\nHealth and workout trackingView image in fullscreenThe SE 3 has the same crown and side button as the Series 11 but lacks the metal contacts on the back for taking ECGs. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne of the biggest cuts for the SE 3 is the removal of the electrical sensor from the back of the watch, which enables electrocardiograms (ECG) of your heart on the Series and Ultra watches. It also lacks a blood oxygen sensor and hypertension monitoring but it still has an accurate optical heart rate sensor that covers most bases, including high and low heart rate notifications.The SE 3 also has a skin temperature sensor, which is used as part of the Vitals app, the sleep tracking and for retrospective ovulation estimates for the cycles tracking app. The watch also does a good job of tracking general workouts, including walks, runs, cycles and other common sports and activities with its GPS.The watch also supports offline music playback via Bluetooth headphones, including from subscription services such as Spotify. And it has offline Apple Maps, should you get lost without your phone.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium body is available in starlight (as pictured) or midnight (black). Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Repairs cost between £195 and £229 depending on the model.It contains more than 40% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report.PriceThe Apple Watch SE 3 costs from £219 (€269/$249/A$399) for the 40mm version or £249 (€299/$279/A$449) for 44mm.For comparison, the Apple Watch Series 11 costs £369 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs £749.VerdictThe Apple Watch SE 3 is the best deal in Apple’s smartwatch line this year, offering almost everything that’s great about the Series 11 but at a significantly cheaper price.The new always-on display, S10 chip and watchOS 26 make the SE 3 just as good day to day. The only meaningful feature you miss out on is the ability to take ECGs, but if you know you don’t need it then that’s no loss. The 1.5-day battery life of the 40mm isn’t too bad but the larger 44mm should last a little longer.The limited choice of colours is easily remedied with a bright strap, while the older design with smaller screens, larger bezels and a thicker body is easy to live with for the price.\n Pros: great value Apple Watch, always-on screen, Apple Pay, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, decent health and fitness tracking, long software support, recycled materials, 50-metre water resistance.\n Cons: no ECG, no blood oxygen monitoring, no hypertension alerts, old design, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, screen not super bright in sunlight.\nView image in fullscreenThe new Exactograph face from watchOS 26 looks good on the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3.

        "content": "The Oakley Meta Vanguard are new displayless AI glasses designed for running, cycling and action sports with deep Garmin and Strava integration, which may make them the first smart glasses for sport that actually work.They are a replacement for running glasses, open-ear headphones and a head-mounted action cam all in one, and are the latest product of Meta’s partnership with the sunglasses conglomerate EssilorLuxottica, the owner of Ray-Ban, Oakley and many other top brands.But where the popular Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer camera-equipped AI smart glasses are designed for general leisure, the Vanguard are unashamedly sports glasses designed to go fast and capture your efforts as you do it.That makes them some of the most expensive screenless AI glasses you can get, starting at a not insignificant £499 (€549/$499/A$789), sitting above the £399 Oakley Meta HSTN and £379 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer.View image in fullscreenThe glasses come with three sizes of silicone nose pads to adjust the fit, which is secure and well balanced. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Vanguard don’t look like your standard smart glasses. It is clear Meta brought the technology but Oakley brought the design, fit and finish. The huge wraparound visor, arms and three-point fit system mimic the excellent Oakley Sephara sport glasses, which keeps their 66g frame glued to your head no matter how hard you shake them or how sweaty you get, and they fit under helmets.There are two frame colours and four contrast-enhancing lenses to choose from, but no option for prescription lenses. A small button on the left arm near the hinge allows you to turn the glasses on and off so you can use them just as sunglasses.View image in fullscreenThe speaker is next to the large camera button and smaller action button, which can be set to a range of different functions in the Meta AI app. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianA speaker is hidden in each arm that points towards your ear for listening to music, calls or Meta’s AI chatbot. They are some of the best-sounding open-ear speakers you can get and are more than loud enough to be heard over road or wind noise. They can’t match a set of earbuds for bass but for music while running or just out walking they are great. The five beamforming mics also do a very good job of cutting out background noise, even on busy roads, for calls or talking to AI.The right arm has a touch panel for controlling playback and volume manually. The music pauses when you take the glasses off, and the volume automatically adjusts to the level of background noise, which works really well while running around roads.Specifications\n \n  Dimensions: 136 x 120 x 59mm\n \n  Weight: 66g (258g case)\n \n  Water resistance: IP67\n \n  Camera: 12MP/3K ultrawide\n \n  Speakers: stereo open ear\n \n  Mics: 5-mic array\n \n  Battery life: 6h music playback (30h with case)\n \n  Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 6\n \n  Storage: 32GB\nHey Meta, take a photoView image in fullscreenThe ultra-wide camera is mounted squarely between your eyes, which you can’t see when wearing them, with an LED directly above that lights when the camera is active. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe central camera shoots 12-megapixel photos of reasonable quality and really good stabilised video up to 3K resolution for up to five minutes at a time. It can also shoot hyperlapses, which are a series of action shots stitched together into one sped-up clip, or slo-mo videos at up to 120 frames a second at 720p.The camera can’t match a high-end phone but is very good for capturing the action as it happens, similar to the typical mid-range action cameras people strap to themselves. Press the camera button for photos or press and hold for videos, or you can ask Meta AI to take a photo or capture a video hands-free.All these features, including music, auto volume and basic voice controls for volume, playback and the camera, work when connected to any Bluetooth device, such as a running watch. But for more advanced AI features the glasses need to be connected to an Android or iPhone running the Meta AI app.View image in fullscreenThe Meta AI app handles settings for the glasses and syncs media, shows language translations and transcriptions of your conversations with the chatbot. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianYou can ask Meta AI questions like any other chatbot, including what you are looking at using the camera. It can identify plants, translate text and generally interrogate the world around you. It is extremely handy for converting distances and paces between metric and imperial mid-run but isn’t quite as capable as Google’s Gemini on a phone.You can also message, send photos and call friends hands-free from the glasses via your phone or with one of Meta’s apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram.Hey Meta, what’s my pace?Vanguard’s killer feature is excellent integration with modern Garmin running watches and bike computers. A free Meta AI app on your Garmin links to the Meta AI app on your phone so you can interrogate your stats in real time mid-activity simply by asking.View image in fullscreenA little LED flashes next to your right eye to tell you when the AI is listening, interacting, or a photo is being taken. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe AI can tell you any of your individual metrics, such as pace, distance, heart rate, cadence and others, or the lot by asking for “my stats”, all pulled directly from your Garmin at that moment. It will also read out the pace or other metrics for each lap, mile or kilometre and can use the little LED to the right of your eye to show if you are on target during a pace or heart rate zone workout, turning red when you are outside your zone.The Garmin integration also enables the camera to automatically capture your walking, hiking, running or riding workouts. It shoots five-second videos for every kilometre or mile, or when you hit certain milestones such as a burst of pace for a sprint finish or when your heart rate ramps up on a steep incline. Once you have finished, the Meta AI app then stitches the videos together with any you took manually into a highlights reel when you get back. You can then overlay stats from the workout, such as distance, pace, elevation, time, heart rate and power, and send it to Meta’s apps or Strava to automatically add to your existing workout post.View image in fullscreenThe Meta AI app shows workout summaries and processes your auto-capture videos from the glasses. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe whole thing works fantastically, and while you’re not going to want to create videos for every run, automatically capturing highlights from a race without you having to do anything is a great bonus.Capturing all this video dents the battery life. On an hour-long run listening to music and talking to Meta AI lots of times, with 14 five-second videos auto-captured and 13 minutes of 1080p/30fps video and 14 photos taken manually, the glasses ended the run with 25% battery left.They should last for a full marathon with auto-capture turned on, but you may have to be careful with extended shooting to make the full 42km distance.For those who don’t use a Garmin, the Meta AI app can integrate with Apple Health, Google Health Connect or Strava to pull data from other watches or bike computers after the fact, including the Apple Watch and Coros devices. But the metrics overlaid on videos are more limited, and you get none of the auto-capture or mid-run stats.View image in fullscreenThe glasses last for up to six hours of continuous music listening and are stored in a chunky Oakley case, which offers four additional charges and will automatically transfer your photos and videos to the cloud while charging. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSustainabilityThe battery in the glasses will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full-charge cycles. Replacement lenses (£69), charging cases (£139) and nose pads (£10) will be available but the glasses are not repairable and the batteries not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. The glasses do not contain recycled material and Meta does not operate trade-in schemes or publish environmental impact reports for the glasses.PriceThe Oakley Meta Vanguard cost £499 (€549/$499/A$789).For comparison, the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (gen 2) cost from £379, the Oakley Meta HSTN cost from £399, the Oakley Sphaera cost £191 and the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 cost £169.VerdictThe Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses for sport I’ve ever tested. They are extremely expensive but it’s very clear they are designed for runners and sports by people who actually run.By concentrating on things runners, cyclists and adventure sports people want, such as a fit that won’t quit, lenses that actually block the wind from your eyes, proper water resistance, loud open-ear audio, long battery life and good controls, they would be great without more of the fancy features.The nose-mounted camera is very good and could easily replace an action cam for many. The mics continue to work at pace and Meta’s built-in AI is useful for answering those mid-run questions that always pop into your head.But the killer feature it is the integration with Garmin, for stats mid-run and for automatic highlights reels of your routes from the camera. It’s just so easy but requires carrying your phone on a run, which is a bit of a drag. Strava and other fitness app links offer something for non-Garmin users.If you ditch the phone and use them directly with a running watch for music, the auto-volume and basic voice commands for volume, playback and the camera still work.The very high price is hard to swallow but the biggest issue is the irreplaceable battery: you can swap the lenses and nose pads but like most earbuds and other smart glasses they are unrepairable, losing them a star.\n Pros: big and great lenses, secure fit, well balanced, loud open-ear speakers, noise-mounted camera, IP67 water resistance, long battery life, good case, excellent Garmin integration, good Strava and other fitness app links, swappable lenses and nose pads.\n Cons: very expensive, unrepairable, needs phone for most advanced features, overkill for just audio on runs.\nView image in fullscreenThe Oakley logo forms part of the touchpad for controlling music playback and volume.

        "content": "The biggest, baddest and boldest Apple Watch is back for its third generation, adding a bigger screen, longer battery life and satellite messaging for when lost in the wilderness.The Ultra 3 is Apple’s answer to adventure watches such as Garmin’s Fenix 8 Pro while being a full smartwatch for the iPhone with all the trimmings. As such, it is not cheap, costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399) – £50 less than 2023’s model – sitting above the £369-plus Series 11 and £219 Watch SE 3.From the outside it doesn’t look like a lot has changed for the Ultra 3 over its two-year-old predecessor. Available in natural or black titanium, it is exactly the same size but squeezes in a slightly bigger screen with smaller bezels making it the largest on an Apple Watch.The display is much brighter when viewed at an angle, which makes seeing it at a glance a lot easier, and now shows ticking seconds when idle like the Series 10 and 11. It is very bright, covered by super-hard sapphire glass and has one of the very best screens on a watch.View image in fullscreenThe chunky crown and armoured side button help prevent accidental presses during workouts while still making them easy to use with gloves. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ultra 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and the same excellent touch-free gestures. Double tap your thumb and index finger to press buttons or scroll, or flick your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss alarms, notifications or return to the watch face.Apple has managed to fit a 6% larger battery into the Ultra 3, which lasts a good three-plus days between charges with general usage and sleep tracking over night. Most people will need to put it on the charger every third night, which is a good day longer than any other Apple Watch, although some way behind the week-long battery of adventure watch rivals from Garmin and others.The watch fully charges in about two hours, hitting 50% in 30 minutes via the included USB-C magnetic charging puck.Satellite and 5GThe watch supports 5G, if you have a compatible phone plan, and has noticeably stronger cellular reception in weaker signal areas for 4G. Apple has also brought its free satellite SOS messaging from the iPhone to the Ultra 3, which allows you to contact the emergency services via text using satellites when out of cellular signal range. Satellites can also be used for Find My location tracking and messages to friends and loved ones, although the latter is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico, and both need a compatible cellular data plan.The Ultra 3 runs the same recent watchOS 26 software as the Series 11 and other Apple Watches, which introduced a revamped design and some new watch faces. In addition, the Ultra 3 has an attractive new Waypoint watch face, which has a live compass that shows points of interest around you. It joins a few other information-dense Ultra-exclusive faces, including the Wayfinder and Modular Ultra.View image in fullscreenA selection of faces for the Ultra 3, including the new Exactograph (top left), Waypoint (top middle) and Flux (top right) and a shot of the always-on display off angle.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ultra supports the same comprehensive health and fitness-tracking capabilities as the standard Apple Watch. That includes a wealth of heart health monitoring, such as ECG, abnormal rhythm notifications, blood oxygen tracking, and new hypertension alerts that analyse 30-days of readings for signs of high blood pressure.It has Apple’s new sleep score metric, which makes it easier to understand your tracked sleep, plus wrist temperature monitoring, cycle tracking with ovulation estimation and many other tools.The Ultra builds on the workout tracking of the standard Apple Watch in a couple of ways. The extra action button in the side can be used to quickly start a workout, but unlike Apple’s other watches you can wait until you have a GPS lock before starting the exercise by pressing it again.View image in fullscreenThe precision start feature is exclusive to the Ultra, but should be on the standard Apple Watch, too. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe best bit is a dual-band GPS system that boosts tracking accuracy in tricky environments, such as dense urban areas with tall buildings or in woods. It’s a feature found on the top running watches and has been improved since the initial Ultra to become one of the most accurate on the market, matching or beating the very best in urban GPS stress tests.It also tracks a good number of metrics including the usual distance, pace and cadence, plus running power and dynamics, training load and heart rate zones. It can be loaded with structured workouts such as intervals, and it has a very good track detection mode for doing laps. The Ultra has similarly good cycling, swimming and triathlon profiles, plus diving to 40-metre depths and at least 22 other activities.View image in fullscreenThe bright orange action button can be customised to trigger different features, including workouts, a torch, stopwatch, voice memos or other actions. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianCombined with the large and bright screen, and the decent 11 to 14-hour battery life when tracking running at its highest accuracy levels, the Ultra 3 makes for a surprisingly good sports watch.The Ultra also supports Apple’s new Workout Buddy AI coach, which works with walks, runs, hikes, cycling and various other training workouts, giving you pep-talks before, during and after activities via Bluetooth headphones. But it requires you to carry an iPhone 15 Pro or later for it to work, which is a drag.SustainabilityApple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Damage repairs cost £489.The watch contains more than 40% recycled material, including cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report.PriceThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 comes in a choice of two colours and multiple bands costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399).VerdictThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, baddest and best Apple Watch the company makes but it isn’t a massive leap over previous models.Other than satellite SOS messaging, which could genuinely save your life in an emergency, the rest of the watch is simply a refinement of the Ultra 2.But the added battery life is very welcome, so is a bigger and fancier screen in the same size watch. New software features are great and the wrist-flick gesture for dismissing things is the best thing added to any Apple Watch in recent memory.The Ultra is still a rarer sight than other models, so if you wanted a less ubiquitous Apple Watch this is it. While those looking for a dedicated top-priced sports watch might overlook it in favour of a Garmin or similar, the Ultra 3 has all the ingredients to be a first-rate training companion – as long as you can charge it more frequently – while still being the best smartwatch you can get with an iPhone.The Ultra 3 is the best Apple Watch. Just don’t expect it to be a massive upgrade over older Ultra models.\n Pros: fantastic screen, rugged yet sophisticated design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, three-day battery life, 5G and satellite SOS/messaging, top health tracking, great activity tracking with dual-band GPS, extra action button, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre dive-ready, long software support.\n Cons: very expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, no big upgrade on previous Ultra models, shorter battery life than adventure watch rivals.\nView image in fullscreenThe Ultra 3 is a big Apple Watch, but fairly compact and easy to slip under cuffs compared with the adventure watch competition.

        "content": "The latest update to Garmin’s class-leading Fenix adventure watch adds something that could save your life: phone-free communications and emergency messaging on 4G or via satellite.The Fenix 8 Pro takes the already fantastic Fenix 8 and adds in the new cellular tech, plus the option of a cutting-edge microLED screen in a special edition of the watch. It is Garmin’s top model and designed to be the only tool you need to more-or-less go anywhere and track anything.That makes it an extremely pricey proposition starting at £1,030 (€1,200, $1,200, A$2,300) for the 47mm OLED version and stretching to a colossal £1,730 (€2,000/$2,000/A$3,399) for the 51mm version with microLED display – almost twice the price of the regular Fenix 8.You do get a lot of watch for your money with best-in-class workout, activity and adventure tracking. The full offline maps of the globe can automatically guide you back on to the trail if you get lost without a phone, and look great on the large, sharp and super-bright touchscreen.View image in fullscreenThe Fenix 8 Pro is thicker and heavier than the standard Fenix 8 by 2.2mm and 4g respectively, and pretty chunky on the wrist. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fenix 8 Pro only comes in 47mm or 51mm case sizes, not the smaller 43mm version Garmin offers in other models, so it is a big watch for big wrists. But the 47mm OLED version as tested does have an extra day of smartwatch-use battery life even with the screen on all the time, lasting a solid eight to nine days between charges.Phone-free messaging, calls and live trackingGarmin has its own inReach LTE (4G) and satellite subscription service instead of relying on a watch plan linked to your phone provider, like other smartwatches. But unlike Apple or Google’s satellite-capable devices, emergency SOS messaging is not included for free.Instead, plans start at £7.99 or equivalent a month, which provides unlimited LTE text and voice messaging, calls and LiveTrack location sharing – so your friends or loved ones can keep an eye on you while out running, cycling or similar – plus emergency satellite SOS messaging.View image in fullscreenThe setup and activation of the inReach subscription is a fairly long-winded affair, but only needs to be done once. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianCheck-ins and texts over satellite are then charged on top, with more expensive plans including various allowances of satellite use, climbing to a £50 a month unlimited plan. The watch comes with a 30-day free trial so you can test out the service.Once you have got it set up, you simply head out the door without your phone and the watch will connect to LTE. You can not use it for streaming music or similar, but you can make and take calls, send texts and generally keep in touch with your family and friends.View image in fullscreenHere are what messages look like on the watch and the recipient’s Garmin Messenger app, including texts, reactions, voice messages and transcriptions. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWhen you text someone, Garmin sends them an SMS from a random phone number, which they can reply to back to your watch. If they install the Garmin Messenger app, you can then message back and forth via text or voice messages, and make voice calls. Your recipient does not need a Garmin account to use the Messenger app, just a phone number is sufficient to register for texts.Messaging on the watch works fine but typing out texts on the tiny on-screen keyboard is slow. It has a set of customisable canned responses you can send to speed things up. Voice messages and calls work OK, though as with most smartwatches, you’re not going to want to use it for extended conversations as the quality is not fantastic.LiveTrack is the most useful feature. You can configure it to automatically send a link to chosen contacts every time you start an activity, so they can follow your real time location on a map. It’s great for following race progress, but it mostly serves as a tool for someone you trust to know your whereabouts in case something happens. It has generally worked well, though the real location has sometimes lagged when moving in and out of good LTE signal.View image in fullscreenSending satellite messages requires that you point your watch in the right direction and face it to an unobstructed view of the sky.  Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAll of these features are available on other Garmin watches if you carry your phone with you, but in the places where LTE does not reach, the satellite kicks in on the Fenix 8 Pro to send texts, location check-ins and emergency SOS.A guide shows you how to find the line of sight to the satellite, which then sends and receives messages within about 10 to 30 seconds. It was surprisingly easy to use and could be a crucial lifeline, though it is important to note that satellite coverage is restricted to the US mainland, most of Canada, and most of Europe except for parts of Scandinavia above 65 degrees north.SustainabilityThe watch is generally repairable with options available via the support site. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin offers recycling schemes on new purchases.PriceThe Fenix 8 Pro costs from £1,029.99 (€1,199.99/$1,199.99/A$2,299). The optional Garmin inReach subscription plans cost begins from £7.99 (€9.99/$7.99/A$13.50).VerdictThe Fenix 8 Pro takes a fantastic adventure watch in the regular Fenix 8 and adds LTE for messaging, calls and LiveTrack – plus satellite messaging, check-in and emergency SOS for when you’re out of signal.The result is an even more impressive adventure tool for those that want to be phone-free. If you want to have someone keep an eye on you remotely while running out at night or in the middle of nowhere, the Garmin does so without needing anything else.It is quite freeing to be outside without a phone, but that capability comes at quite a cost, both in terms of the colossal price of the watch and the monthly subscription of the inReach plan to provide the service. At least it isn’t dependent on your phone provider so works with any brand of smartphone and network.The Fenix 8 Pro is a killer device for someone who hates being weighed down by their phone when running, cycling or hiking, but still wants to be trackable and contactable. For everyone else, it is a lot of money when the excellent Fenix 8 already exists.\n Pros: LTE and satellite messaging, super-bright OLED screen, tracks everything with best-in-class GPS, built-in torch, phone and offline voice control, 8+ day battery life, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping and routes, offline Spotify, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre diving, buttons and touch.\n Cons: extremely expensive, LTE and satellite features need monthly subscription, limited Garmin Pay bank support, voice features are slow, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches."
